<h2>THE GIRL SCOUTS<br />
AT SEA CREST</h2>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>SAME OLD OCEAN</h3>


<div class='cap'>THREE girls stood on the beach watching
the waves&mdash;the tireless, endless, continuous
toss, break, splash; toss, break,
splash! Always the same climbing combers
smoothly traveling in from eternity, mounting
their hills to the playful height of liquid summits,
then rolling down in an ocean of foam, to
splash on the beach into the most alluring of
earth's play toys&mdash;the breakers.</div>

<p>"And we thought the baby mountain at
Bellaire beautiful&mdash;why this ocean is&mdash;well, it
is simply bigger and grander than anything I
have ever dreamed of," declared Grace. "No
wonder the girls out in Chicago long to spend a
summer at the sea shore."</p>

<p>"I couldn't even find a word to describe it,"
admitted Cleo. "Doesn't it look like eternity
all spilled out?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>"And the roll is like the origin of noise,"
suggested Grace. "Now, Weasie, what do you
see that looks like&mdash;like the original public
service telephone company, or the first gas and
electric plant? Don't you think those glints of
color and sparks of foam may be our first
sulphur springs?"</p>

<p>"I never could claim a poetic imagination,"
admitted Louise, known to her chums as Weasie,
"but I might see a family resemblance there to&mdash;well&mdash;to
a first-class Turkish bath. There!
How the mighty hath fallen! From the origin
of noise and eternity spilled out, down to a mundane
yet highly desirable Turkish bath! And
girls, mine is the only practical description, for
a bath it is to be, ours for all summer! Can you
imagine it?"</p>

<p>"And smell the salt?" prompted Cleo. "Since
you insist on being practical, no use talking
about the aroma of the gods, or the incense of
the mermaids. Weasie, I see you are going to
keep us down to earth; and I guess you are
right. Essays are better in school than done
orally on a beautiful beach. But really isn't
it overwhelming?"</p>

<p>"I'll admit that much," replied Weasie.
"But you see, I have had a glimpse of the beach
before. I vacationed here for one week. Then
I have been to Atlantic City in winter. That's
simply wonderful. But you little Westerners,
all the way from Pennsylvania," and she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
laughed at the idea, "you, of course, have only
seen good old Lake Erie. Yes, girls, this is the
ocean. Meet Madame Atlantic," with a sweeping
gesture toward the ocean. "But look out!
That's how Madame Atlantic meets us! Just
look at my pumps!"</p>

<p>A vengeful wave had crept in and deliberately
splashed the three pairs of new summer pumps,
before the girls realized they were being surrounded.</p>

<p>"Well, of all things!" exclaimed Grace.
"How did that wave get in without us seeing
it? And we standing right there watching it!
My shoes are simply done for," and she looked
about for a place to sit down and dump out some
of the damage.</p>

<p>"That's the way with waves," explained
Louise, who now stood sponsor for the ocean
and its habits. "You never can tell just what
a wave will do."</p>

<p>"I see," said Cleo, trying to plough through
the heavy sand without burying the soaking wet
slippers. "I suppose we may call this our
initiation. Changing time at Pittsburg is nothing
to changing pumps at Sea Crest. Let's
to it."</p>

<p>"And salt water is ruinous to leather. I
know that much," declared Grace. "Weasie,
you should have told us to leave our shoes on
land and come into the sands barefoot. I suppose
that's why all the picture dancers are barefoot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
on the sands; it's so hard on slippers.
There's a barrel. Let's anchor that and divest
ourselves. Did you ever see dry land so far
away? This sand is as bad as water to plough
through."</p>

<p>"Knocks the poetry out of it, doesn't it?"
teased Louise. "But don't let's mind. What
are mere pumps to all this?"</p>

<p>They reached the barrel which had been
washed up on the beach and was quite securely
embedded in the sand. On this the three chums
took refuge from the ocean water and sea of
sand, while they attempted to wring out their
soaking socks and hang them on some brush to
dry.</p>

<p>"This is such a lovely big barrel," commented
Cleo. "Let's sit here, and while our
wash dries we can tell marine stories. Grace,
you had better put your pumps up farther.
That island may be washed away with the next
wave."</p>

<p>"I guess I will," agreed Grace. "It seems
to me this old ocean knows we are greenies the
way it tantalizes us. Now there!" and she
placed the two black slippers much farther up
from the line marked by the incoming tide. "I
hope the next set of waves will be polite enough
to keep their distance. Come on to the barrel
and let's hear about Madaline. Why couldn't
she come down?"</p>

<p>They adjusted themselves again on the great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
cask, and Cleo proceeded to narrate the details
of her recent letter from their chum, Madaline.</p>

<p>"Her folks are going to travel this summer
so we can't have our little roly-poly Madaline
with us," she explained. "Of course, we shall
miss her, but we are going to have Mary. Her
rich relations are coming down to the
Colonade."</p>

<p>"To that immense gold-and-white hotel over
there!" exclaimed Grace. "Then we shall have
wonderful times visiting her. And we can see
all the dances and masquerades&mdash;I suppose they
have a very gay season at a hotel like that."</p>

<p>"I saw a circular announcing the opening on
the fifteenth," said Louise. "Perhaps Mary
will be down then and we may be invited."</p>

<p>"I smell fire," interrupted Cleo, "and there
isn't a streak of smoke in sight. Wonder where
it can be?"</p>

<p>"I am sure that <i>is</i> fire somewhere," declared
Grace. "Where <i>can</i> it be!" and she too sniffed
the odor of smoke.</p>

<p>"Oh my!" exclaimed Louise, jumping up and
dragging her chums with her. "We are on
fire! See, it is in the barrel!"</p>

<p>"And my skirt is burned!" declared Grace.
"Just see!" exhibiting a singed hole in her blue
serge skirt.</p>

<p>"However did a fire start in there?" questioned
Cleo. "Let's see."</p>

<p>But there was no need of investigation, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
scarcely had they jumped from their places
when a sheet of flame shot out from the open
end of the otherwise innocent looking cask.</p>

<p>"Land sakes!" declared Louise. "We were
lucky not to be blown up. How did that start
with no one in sight to start it?"</p>

<p>"Maybe we touched off a fuse," suggested
Cleo jokingly.</p>

<p>"No, I'll tell you," offered Grace. "When
we sat on the barrel we shut out the wind from
the side, all but enough to create a draft; and
the paper must have been smoldering. Now,
just look at our perfectly good seat turned into
a beach fire! We had better rescue our socks.
Maybe those sticks will explode under them,
next thing we know."</p>

<p>"Oh, just look here!" called Cleo. "See
what I just kicked up! It's a bottle and has a
note in it! Maybe it's a warning from the firebug,"
she finished, dragging from the sand a
bottle and proceeding to pull out the paper
which had been carefully wound with a cord, the
end of which was brought out at the cork. Cleo
promptly let the cork pop, yanked the string,
and so dislodged the note.</p>

<p>"I knew it," she exclaimed, "a message from
the pirates. Listen to this!"</p>

<p>Grace and Louise hopped back to hear the
contents of the rolled slip of paper.</p>

<p>"Short enough," commented Cleo. "It
simply says, 'Beware of the fire-bug' and it's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
signed 'The Weasle'. Well, I never! Beware
of the fire-bug," she repeated, "and not a human
in sight that fire-bug fires. And signing
himself the Weasle! Must be pretty snappy.
Well, I say girls, as early as we thought we
were getting down, before all the other schools
were dismissed, the little old fire-bug got here
first. What do you make of it?"</p>

<p>"Maybe some one comes in by boat from
some island, and leaves the fires to start up with
a clock signal, like they do it in the movies,"
suggested Grace.</p>

<p>Louise and Cleo laughed the idea to scorn.</p>

<p>"Can you imagine an island in the ocean?"
asked Louise. "And just look at the writing
of this note! It is a perfectly modern school
hand. Some small boy I suppose, who has been
reading too much Captain Kidd. At any rate
let us be glad we didn't burn up more skirts,
although it is too bad to spoil that splendid new
serge, Grace," she finished, commiserating with
the girl who was just then judging the size of
the hole burnt in her skirt by trying to view the
sun through it.</p>

<p>"Oh, perhaps I can fix it," speculated Grace.
"It's a very nice round hole, and I may cover
it with a patch pocket, though it would be
rather low down to trust my wealth to it. However,
it is all right. And the fire will finish drying
our socks and pumps. And also, we have
something to remember in our first beach fire.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
I have often read of them. They usually toast
potatoes and things in the fires, don't they?"</p>

<p>"Marshmallows," corrected Louise, quite
well informed on beach lore. "We'll have a
marshmallow roast when enough of the girls
come down. But it is nice to get here first and
find everything out. When the other schools
close next week I suppose we won't be able to
find one another, with the crowds that will flock
to this beach. And just now we have it all to
ourselves," she finished, looking up and down
the vast expanse of territory known as the ocean
front, and therefore quite as extensive as the
stretch of the ocean itself.</p>

<p>"All the same," insisted Grace, smoothing
again the rolled slip of paper which Cleo had
handed over. "I believe this is written by
someone&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We all do," interrupted Cleo with a smile.</p>

<p>"I mean some one who is a firebug!"</p>

<p>"Oh, come now," teased Louise. "I don't
believe you are as sensational as that, Grace.
Firebugs don't grow in the ocean, like crabs.
Just see that funny crab trying to get in your
slipper. You don't suppose he can write notes,
and start fires, do you?"</p>

<p>"And here's another sort of monster," called
Cleo, who was poking in the sand near the edge.
"I believe this fellow could do most anything if
he had the tools. Just look! Isn't he horrid
looking?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ugh!" exclaimed Grace, "I'm glad I never
eat fish!"</p>

<p>"That's a skate," explained Louise. "No
one eats that sort of fish. Isn't he ugly?" and
a determined thrust with her beach stick (a
piece of bamboo salvaged from the drift wood),
sent the dead monster out into the deep.</p>

<p>"If I had a pencil, I would put an answer to
that letter in the bottle," proposed Cleo. "We
might get a lot of fun out of it."</p>

<p>"And we might also get a visit from friend
fire-bug," cautioned Grace. "And I don't know
whether our cottage is insured or not. But I
do know it has lovely furniture and mother says
it's a perfect joy to come into a house, all spick
and span without having to do the spicking.
No, Cleo, please don't invite the Weasle to
call."</p>

<p>"I have a tiny dance card pencil," offered
Louise. "Let's write a note just for fun. Of
course, no one will ever find it."</p>

<p>Cleo ran up the sand to the board walk where
bits of paper could be seen flying in the early
summer breeze. She returned, presently, with
a piece suitable for their pirate message.</p>

<p>"Let's write a scary answer," she proposed.
"Here, I'll say 'Wild Weasle, take heed! We
have seen your sign and will return for
vengeance!' Signed 'The Pirates!' There!"
she concluded. "If any fire-bug finds that
maybe he will take heed. Where's the bottle?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>Louise produced the erstwhile soda water container,
and into this the girls' letter was poked,
with the poke-string left out at the cork, as per
sample.</p>

<p>"We're beginning early," said Cleo.
"Louise, I'm glad you know the beach. You
may save us from disaster, although we have
had so many experiences first out at Flosston,
then last summer at Bellaire. I suppose, like
trouble, adventure is bound to come to those who
seek it. Now, we are all ready. Have the right
shoes on the right feet, have buried our Pirate
Threat, and so let's go back home. I'm just
crazy to show you the love of a cottage we
have."</p>

<p>"I thought ours was the very prettiest," said
Grace, "but we shall inspect yours first, Cleo.
Then look at mine, and if Louise&mdash;&mdash;-"</p>

<p>"Certainly, I want you to come over and see
my sleeping porch. I hardly believe there is one
prettier here. Come along."</p>

<p>"We should have called out the department,"
said Cleo. "Just fancy them extinguishing
that hole in your skirt, Grace!"</p>

<p>And the romp from the beach echoed with
their merry laughter for all could vision Grace
under the fire hose!</p>

<p>"This way to the Log Cabin!" announced
Cleo leading her friends from the boardwalk
along the Avenue to her quaint summer home.
"Now, for our first inspection!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>THE BOTTLED WARNING</h3>


<div class='cap'>"OH, how curious!" This from Grace.</div>

<p>"Like a mountain house at the seashore.
All field stones and rustic trimmings,"
commented Louise.</p>

<p>"We think it simply great," declared Cleo.
"Come along till I show you the big attic. It
was built for a studio, and looks right over the
ocean. I never dreamed seashore landlords
could offer for rent such a wonder house as
this."</p>

<p>"Folks tire of things so easily, and continually
long for change, I suppose," said
Louise. "But you were lucky to get this, Cleo.
I fancy one of the many artists coming here
would love to have found it first."</p>

<p>"Can you imagine an entire house trimmed
with rough cedar? And just see the length of
these cedar beams! Fully forty feet; they go
straight from one end of the house to the other,"
declared Cleo, proudly pointing out the novelties
of the Log Cabin.</p>

<p>"And just see here!" exclaimed Grace. "A
real dogwood tree trimmed with the most perfect<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
paper flowers. Isn't that simply lovely!"</p>

<p>This last found attraction was a novelty indeed,
for it was nothing less than a fine sized
dogwood tree standing against a latticed cedar
screen; and this tree of natural wood was decorated
with perfectly made paper flowers&mdash;quite
as if the original blooms had developed into the
"everlasting" variety. A wonderful fireplace
of field stones opened in the living room, and
sent its tower clear to the studio on the third
floor; while every board and stick in the cottage
was either of rough natural cedar, or the same
wood chastened to bring out the marvellous
tones of color that can only be described as
cedar.</p>

<p>It was, in truth, a remarkable summer home;
and while we leave the girls here to explore its
glories, we may take a moment to recall the
other two volumes of this series: "The Girl
Scout Pioneers; or Winning the First B. C."
and the second "The Girl Scouts at Bellaire;
or Maid Mary's Awakening."</p>

<p>In the first we were treated to an intimate
view of girl scouting as it is worked out in the
groups known as patrols and troops. The
True Tred Troop of Flosston, a Pennsylvania
mill town, was composed of a lively little company
indeed, and these American girls were
given an opportunity of working and lending
influence to a group of mill girls, whose quaint
characteristics and innate resourcefulness make<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
an attractive background for our story picture.</p>

<p>How the runaway girls were reclaimed, how
a little woodland fairy, Jacqueline, worked out
a scout fantasy, and how a very modest deed
won the first Bronze Cross, makes the first
volume of this series a book calculated to inspire
as well as to fascinate the reader.</p>

<p>The second volume: "The Girl Scouts at
Bellaire," narrates the remarkable experience
of our True Treds in a mountain town in New
Jersey, where, while spending a vacation, they
discover Maid Mary, the orphan of the orchids,
a child of strange fancies and queer tropical
influences, who has been made a victim of the
orchid seekers to the extent of being kept from
her relations until the rare bulb is found by the
Girl Scouts.</p>

<p>The glory of the orchids, with their delightful
colors and their rarest of perfumes, permeates
the story, while the vague, subtle influence
of queer foreigners lends sufficient
clouds to bring out the real beauties of the tale.
The Girl Scout Series is intended to furnish the
best sort of good reading in an attractive style,
suited at once to the needs of the girl's mind,
and her natural enjoyment of the story, while
it will stand the most critical censorship of parents
and caretakers of the plastic minds of
young girls.</p>

<p>And now our girls are ransacking the Log
Cabin from roof to landing, (there is no cellar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
to the beach cottage) and on this the first day
of their vacation at Sea Crest, hours are all too
short in which to cram the joys of exploration.</p>

<p>"I have never seen a place like this," declared
Grace, when all three scouts came to a
halt finally on the low couch under the indoor
dogwood tree. "We can have lovely parties
here, can't we, Cleo?"</p>

<p>"Surely," agreed the hostess. "But girls,
what shall we do about scouting this summer?"
she asked, diverting suddenly to a more serious
question. "You see, there is no troop here, and
it is such an opportunity for good scouting, with
all the wilds of the ocean and cliffs, as a background.
I feel perhaps, we should organize.
Suppose we organize a summer troop of just
our own girls? Margaret and Julia will be here
this week, and you know many more from school
will be down later."</p>

<p>"Oh let's call ourselves the Sea Gulls. Then
we would have an excuse for taking rides in
that airplane that goes up from the park," suggested
the ever venturesome Grace.</p>

<p>"I'd like it," agreed Louise. "Then, too, we
could wear our uniforms a lot, and I am sure I
shall have to wear something to help out on
cutting down laundry until real hot weather.
Do you know, girls, there is no such thing as
obtaining help? And our Susie insisted on
getting married, so would not come down with
us."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>"And mother wouldn't even try to get a perfectly
strange maid," said Cleo. "I don't mind
helping out by wearing a uniform on cool days,
but I don't believe I should enjoy doing a lot of
housework. I would rather go scouting for
maids," she insisted.</p>

<p>"We might even do that," replied Grace, "but
now let's hie to the next cottage. I think mine
is next."</p>

<p>It was so early in the season that not many of
the summer places were open, but in almost
every cottage workers were busy, opening the
boarded windows, (all windows on the ocean
side have to be boarded up to withstand the
winter storms) fixing up the grounds, opening
garages, and generally preparing for the summer
influx.</p>

<p>"Here we are!" announced Grace, leading
her companions up through the well groomed
lawn, then under the rose arch over which the
word "Rosabell" was wrought in rustic characters,
with the rose vines threading in and out,
and punctuating each letter with sprays of buds
almost ready to bloom.</p>

<p>"Oh, isn't that pretty!" enthused Cleo. "I
believe the light dainty cottage is really prettier
than our gloomy old log cabin."</p>

<p>"And such porch furniture!" enthused
Louise. "You can have a lovely scout meeting
out here Grace. Let's hurry and organize so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
we can have a meeting," suggested Louise in
sincere compliment to "Rosabell."</p>

<p>Within the cottage the rooms were all done
in a chintz and hung in wonderful gauzy draperies,
almost unknown to city houses, but quite
indispensable to the summer resort.</p>

<p>"And wait until you see my room," Grace
told her friends. "I am sure you will like it."</p>

<p>"Oh, a marine room," exclaimed Cleo, as they
entered a corner all decorated with sea trophies,
including star fish, the sword of a sword fish,
tortoise shells, even fishing rods and queer
tackle hung on the background of seine or
fish net, that almost covered one side of the
marine green walls.</p>

<p>"I chose this room although Benny wanted
it," said Grace, "but I had first choice, so he
got an extra play room over the garage, where
boys' noise would not sound quite so telephonic,"
she ventured. "I wondered why people
left this sort of thing up in a summer cottage,
where usually, they say, things must be so
sanitary and practical, but it seems the boy
who owned them was a Jackie, and his mother
wouldn't have the room disturbed."</p>

<p>"Sakes-a-live!" exclaimed Louise. "He may
come in the window some night while taking a
stroll in his seaplane, Grace. Better keep a
screen in this lovely long window," she admonished.</p>

<p>"Oh, I shall, although I just love Jackies and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
intend to make a lot of friends down at the life
saving station. That is where we ought to be
able to apply some choice scouting," said Grace,
rearranging a row of green bound books, that,
like everything else in the room, harmonized in
the marine effect.</p>

<p>"Don't go turning crabbed, or getting fishy,
or even mermaiding in this room, Grace,"
teased Cleo. "It is so effective I should rather
fear the effect taking root. Just look at this
real little alligator and he is actually strong
enough to sit on! Did you ever see anything
so cunning?" The real little alligator or crocodile
was actually standing on his short hind
legs, and in his front (shall we say paws?) he
was holding a flat piece of wood that served for
the seat of the queer stool. It was all very
novel, and everyone decided "Rosabell" was
one of the prettiest cottages in Sea Crest.</p>

<p>"And having decided to organize the Sea
Gulls," Louise remarked, "I think this would
be a particularly appropriate place to hold our
initiations."</p>

<p>"But I thought Cleo had formed a pirate's
league?" teased Grace. "Suppose our Captain
Kidd fire-bug discovers who set off the
beach barrel fuse, and comes around for vengeance
some night? Whoo-pee!" and Grace
demonstrated the revenge with an indescribable
arm swing not listed in her Swedish movements.</p>

<p>"I do think that is sort of queer," commented<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Cleo, "how that fire started, and the way it
burned. Did any one smell oil? All big incendiary
fires are oil soaked always, you
know."</p>

<p>"It might have been oil or it might have been
fish bones, but I did not notice any pungent
odor," declared Louise. "And now for <i>my</i>
cottage. I am afraid there are no thrills left,
so don't be too much disappointed."</p>

<p>"I am sure we will have enough thrills to applaud
you, Weasie dear," said Grace. "It is so
nice to have you with us this year. Of course
we are going to miss our baby Madaline, and
it is a shame we cannot all come to such a lovely
summer place, but having you along does compensate.
And we are always hoping Madie will
come later on. When will Julia and Margaret
arrive?"</p>

<p>"Early next week," Louise replied, "and
Julia has the loveliest new car."</p>

<p>"So have we, and so have you, and so has
Cleo," replied Grace, rather discounting the
glory of the first mentioned. "They may not
all be quite as high-class as Julia's, but I am
sure they are each perfectly first rate. Here
is ours coming in just now. Let's hop in, and
Lenore will run us over to your place, Weasie."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>A COUPLE OF FREAKS</h3>


<div class='cap'>LEONORE, an older sister of the vivacious
Grace, very willingly picked up the trio,
and presently they were contrasting the
ocean air as breathed at a speed rate along the
ocean front, to the same air as gathered "by
hand" from a stationary position.</div>

<p>"It's like drinking air," commented Cleo.
"This is surely liquid air if there is any such
commodity."</p>

<p>"I want to stop at Borden's for a paper,"
said their driver, Leonore. "Grace, will you
kindly hop out and get it?"</p>

<p>The opportunity of inspecting the big pavilion
which was just opened that day for the season,
was eagerly grasped by all three girls, who
promptly decided there were many and various
things they all needed; all of which might be
bought at Borden's, so they hopped out with
conspicuous alacrity.</p>

<p>"Isn't this splendid!" enthused Grace, almost
dancing across the well polished floor.
"We will be sure to want a lot of ice cream this
summer."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>Over in a corner a queer looking girl was
counting and recounting a lot of small change.
First she would finger it from one hand to the
other, almost counting aloud; then she would
drop each coin on the table and its ring counted
aloud for her. This attracted the attention of
the Girl Scouts, who without speaking of it,
were all watching the process with interest.</p>

<p>"Wealth," whispered Louise, "and newly acquired,
I guess."</p>

<p>"Going to treat the world," said Cleo under
her breath. "Too bad they are all out of
balloons."</p>

<p>The girl had finally decided to spend one pile
of the coins she had heaped before her, and the
other she brushed into a little muslin bag, tied
it with a black string and then stuck it carefully
into the neck of her blouse. As if conscious she
was being watched she shuffled awkwardly, then
made her way to the end of the counter, where
the one-time penny candies were sold.</p>

<p>"There!" exclaimed Cleo, when the girl was
well out of hearing. "She is surely a queer
character and worth watching. How do you
suppose she ever came by that famous collection
of modern coins."</p>

<p>"Why, she earned them, I should say,"
guessed Louise. "That's the sort of girl always
available for a mind-the-baby job."</p>

<p>As the girl waited to make her purchase she
kept turning, very boldly, to stare at the scouts,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
who were vainly trying to hide their interest in
the queer character. Evidently <i>she</i> had no misgivings
concerning her interest in them.</p>

<p>First she would shrug her shoulders, then tilt
up her broken straw hat, kick the heel of one
"sneak" against the other, until finally the
clerk spoke sharply to bring her attention to
the point of buying candy.</p>

<p>It took her some time longer to make her
selection and again in counting out her money
she made quite an unnecessary display. A spill
of the coins brought an ill-concealed titter from
Cleo and Grace, and this the girl so sharply resented
that Louise edged her chums to the other
side of the room for safety.</p>

<p>"Fierce!" commented Grace. "Think she
bites?"</p>

<p>"Might," replied Cleo under her breath.</p>

<p>Louise was ordering stamps, and her friends
pretended to examine the alluring display of
new post-cards.</p>

<p>"Oh, my!" whispered Grace. "What is this
we have come upon? Please look over in that
far corner!"</p>

<p>They followed the direction indicated and
saw there a very tall, awkward boy, pouring
over a badly worn book, and making notes on a
slip of yellow paper. He wore glasses, and
possessed that queerly undefinable personality,
usually ascribed to the gawky boy, or he who is
different from others.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>"Look!" begged Louise grasping the arms of
Grace and Cleo. "He has the same kind of
paper we found in the bottle!"</p>

<p>"Our fire-bug!" breathed Cleo, edging away
in mock alarm. "Behold his avenger!" and she
held aloft a pretty yellow lolly-pop lately
chosen from the candy case.</p>

<p>The boy never noticed those about him, but
literally poured over his book and dug notes
out with a stubby pencil.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the girl with the bag of coins had
procured her confections, and was now counting
her change. As she passed the girls she
looked boldly at them and actually stuck out her
tongue!</p>

<p>Grace roared laughing. The outburst caused
the boy in the corner to drop his pencil and
stare.</p>

<p>Then Cleo laughed; Louise joined her, and
all three bolted for the door.</p>

<p>"Oh, I thought I'd choke," gurgled Cleo.
"Did you ever see such circus folks?"</p>

<p>"But the boy with the yellow paper may be
writing us another letter," hazarded Grace.
"We should have gone up boldly and confronted
him."</p>

<p>"I was more interested in slip-shod Letty,"
said Louise. "She looked real daggers, and
what about her threat? She almost shook her
fist at us."</p>

<p>"Oh, she'll be sure to love us, that's certain,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
commented Cleo, "but I don't see why we should
let her act so bold. We ran as if we were
afraid of her."</p>

<p>"We were afraid of ourselves&mdash;thought we
were going to get into a fit of laughing," admitted
Grace.</p>

<p>"Come on," urged Louise. "Leonore will be
out of patience."</p>

<p>"I thought you were going to buy the store
out," said the waiting girl, impatiently pressing
the self starter button and the car rumbled
off.</p>

<p>"No danger," replied Grace. "But we saw
the funniest folks," and she proceeded to tell
of their near-encounter with the girl they
named Letty, and then mentioned the glimpse
they had of the queer, studious boy.</p>

<p>"A couple of freaks," said Leonore, as the
car picked up speed. "There are plenty of
them around here, and you little girl scouts better
watch out. Some one may find you off your
guard," she finished good-naturedly.</p>

<p>When the girls settled down they exchanged
opinions on the morning's experience. No little
country coin collector could open fire on
them that way, without paying some penalty.
Not if they knew it.</p>

<p>"And think of her sticking her tongue out,"
exclaimed Grace. "Of all the rude tricks!"</p>

<p>"I do believe she would have punched me if
she had dared," remarked Cleo.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, she had better wait&mdash;just wait," said
Louise with a threat in her voice. "We are
sure to meet Letty again and then&mdash;just wait!"</p>

<p>"And the boy with the yellow paper," Cleo
reminded her chums. "What about him?"</p>

<p>"There's plenty of yellow paper," replied
Grace, "but of course he might be our fire-bug.
He looked sort of unconscious."</p>

<p>"Didn't notice you looking at him, that <i>was</i>
queer," teased Louise.</p>

<p>"Oh, I think I saw your gray eyes rolling
over in his corner," fired back Grace.</p>

<p>"Not even the entire volley brought him to
his senses," put in Cleo, "for I must admit <i>I</i>
was looking over his way myself."</p>

<p>"Well, here we are. Thanks for the lift,
Leonore," said Louise as the car stopped in
front of the glistening white cottage, one of the
show places of Sea Crest.</p>

<p>"Oh, how fine!" exclaimed Cleo. "Like
Crystal Palace, so white and shiny."</p>

<p>And then began the third lap in their inspection
of the summer cottages.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>MARGARET-BY-THE-DAY</h3>


<div class='cap'>"WHY shouldn't we do it?" argued Margaret,
who with Julia had joined her
chums at Sea Crest. "I think it would
be just as much fun as playing a game, and
heaps more useful."</div>

<p>"Mother would hardly allow us," drawled
Cleo. "She might appreciate our courage, but
to really try doing a washing!"</p>

<p>"Why not?" insisted Grace. "I'm just dying
to try one of those motors. I think it would
be almost as exciting as driving a car. Do let
us Cleo. You know how it works."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know how to touch the button and
turn on the switch, but how about making the
starch?"</p>

<p>Everybody joined in the laugh that followed
the admission of not knowing the common
kitchen starch process, while having an idea of
a modern electric appliance.</p>

<p>"That's what ails our domestic science class.
We study the washing machine, but omit the
starch," said Louise. "Well, suppose we do
just that and don't bother with the stiffness."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>Teased into compliance Cleo led her chums
to the out-of-door laundry, which was built as
a part of the bathing houses just off the kitchen.</p>

<p>It might have been the lure of the nice new,
white washing machine, with its buzzing electric
motor, but whatever the cause the girls finally
succeeded in winning Cleo's permission that
they try it.</p>

<p>"I'm going to be boss," insisted Margaret,
rolling up her sleeves with more gusto than
seemed necessary, for in the process her fist
came in contact with Cleo's eye.</p>

<p>The friendly bout that followed delayed the
washing somewhat, but the scouts were at least
on their way.</p>

<p>They had the log cabin all to themselves; and
the manner in which they took possession might
have been taken to indicate they had the world
to themselves, for they made quite as much
noise as a real troop, instead of the prospective
summer troop they were forming themselves
into.</p>

<p>"Now first," ordered Margaret, giving her
skirt a very effective but unnecessary hitch,
"first we sort the clothes."</p>

<p>"Ye-s&mdash;" agreed Julia. "But h-o-w?"</p>

<p>"Why just sort them, of course," evaded
Margaret.</p>

<p>"Into nice neat little heaps," offered Cleo,
stretching out a sheet on the narrow floor, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
thereby doing deadly damage to the white muslin.</p>

<p>"I know that the table linen should be absolutely
separate," declared Julia authoritatively,
beginning on the small collection of table
stuff. "Please Grace, fetch me the basket."</p>

<p>"I need the basket for my collection," objected
Grace. "Mine is much the most. I
have the underlies," she catalogued, holding up
a dainty hand-made camisole that was surely
never intended to enter an amateur washing
contest.</p>

<p>"Lovely," exclaimed Louise, dropping a pair
of silk hose into the neat little pile of table
linen.</p>

<p>"There," cried Margaret. "We surely
didn't undertake this as an inspection. Let's
get right at the wash, Cleo, please put some
water in the machine."</p>

<p>"However do you do that?" asked Grace in
genuine awe, for plainly the washing machine
was not connected with any water faucet.</p>

<p>"Why, I have to put that hose on that tub
over there and fill it that way," proudly explained
the wash-day hostess. "I should think,
Margaret, if you are going to be boss you would
understand something of the system," she
joked.</p>

<p>"Oh, I just love to be Margaret-by-the-day,"
answered the self-appointed supervisor, "but
even she, you remember, did not know all about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
electric washing machines. Now let's see how
the hose works."</p>

<p>But no need to see, they could <i>feel</i>, for the
hose had slipped from its niche in the washing
machine, and seemed to be pouring out volumes
of water on everybody.</p>

<p>"Turn it off," shouted Louise, already
pretty wet and surely getting wetter.</p>

<p>To save more direct contact Cleo had pointed
the nozzle at the roof, and now a light shower
was descending on the erstwhile washerwomen,
and their pretty little piles of selected apparel.</p>

<p>Presently the faucet was reached and the
hose properly directed into the cylinder, and
while the water flowed in, Margaret put down
the first batch, which was quite properly composed
of the table linen.</p>

<p>"Now the washing powder," called Cleo.
"Here it is all nicely stocked and ready. I
think it should be very lightly sprinkled on."</p>

<p>"Oh no, never!" protested Louise. "That
would simply eat holes in everything. You
have to dilute it. I heard our maid say so."</p>

<p>"All right, I just as soon," agreed Cleo,
giggling helplessly. "But go ahead and dilute.
I'm having trouble enough here."</p>

<p>"Say," inquired Julia innocently. "I
thought these electric washing machines did all
the washing. Why don't they do it then?" and
this afforded a new cause for laughter that
simply demoralized the entire squad.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>Finally Grace had diluted the washing powder
and was pouring it over the linen, regardless
of their lovely colored borders, that should
never have known anything stronger than the
purest soap. Then the cylinder cover was
clapped on and fastened (Cleo understood the
importance of this), and while all the girls
stood at a safe distance she threw in the switch,
and touched the button.</p>

<p>Thereat the Girl Scouts' washing went on as
merrily as a merry-go-round at a picnic.</p>

<p>"We can go out and play croquet while it
washes," announced Cleo grandly. "That's
the beauty of these washers."</p>

<p>They agreed that was real beauty, and off
they romped to the brand new croquet set, to
try their skill at pegging balls under wire wickets.</p>

<p>"I think I'll go in and make the starch,"
Margaret proposed, as she missed a wire.
"Those clothes will be done presently, and we
mustn't wait too long between the acts. You
know how tiresome that always is."</p>

<p>"Well, if you insist," replied Cleo. "You
will find the starch where I got the powder.
Just help yourself," and off went the practical
Margaret, quite determined to earn her title of
"boss."</p>

<p>But there were no directions on the starch
box. That was queer thought the little scout,
every box should carry its own directions. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
of course, it must be very simple to make starch.</p>

<p>One pours water on it surely, she did that.
Then one cooks it&mdash;Margaret proceeded to do
that, and before she could reach a spoon to stir
the mass, the lovely white starch had congealed
into a big bubbly pan cake, that wouldn't stir,
wouldn't turn and wouldn't&mdash;do anything, but
burn&mdash;and my, how it did burn!</p>

<p>"Looks like a real pudding," she told herself
in desperation, trying frantically to move the
mass from the bottom of the white enameled
pan.</p>

<p>The odor of the burning starch brought her
companions in on a run.</p>

<p>"What's the matter? Don't burn down the
house," implored Grace. "My, that's worse
than the fish cake Cleo burned in the mud hole
in the woods. You don't make starch solid,
Margy, you have to make it runny, all gooy like,
don't you know?"</p>

<p>"Of course, I know," retorted Margaret,
"but I didn't do this, it did itself. I had it all
nice and gooy for about half a second, then
it cemented into adamant. There! I hate
starch!" she admitted, ending up in a gale of
laughter that advertised defeat.</p>

<p>"Oh, run out and stop that motor Louise,"
called Cleo. "It has been running half an
hour."</p>

<p>As the starch making process was being operated
in the kitchen, and the machine was out in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the laundry, Louise left the former conference
to attend to the latter requirement.</p>

<p>"Oh my!" shouted Louise, "Come here, it's
shooting sparks all over!"</p>

<p>And just as she said, the motor was emitting
a series of flashes that flew around with absolute
disregard of aim or purpose.</p>

<p>It took sometime for Cleo to get up courage
enough to touch the black button, and when
finally the machine stopped the little group
looked about at the ruin of their hopes.</p>

<p>Then they laughed, and laughed, and roared
and laughed, until Julia ran over to her cottage,
fairly kidnapped her own faithful maid, who,
to save further disaster, came to the log cabin
and reluctantly finished the unfortunate wash.</p>

<p>As the girls hung the pretty white garments
on the line, they each decided to make a note
of the fact that handkerchiefs and napkins are
never starched, and that starch must first be
thoroughly dissolved in cold water before boiling
water is added. Also, that it is very important
to have a spoon in one's hand and begin
stirring as the pouring is begun.</p>

<p>But Margaret-by-the-day proved an interesting
game, if it did slip a cog or two in its development.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>CAPTAIN DAVE</h3>


<div class='cap'>"I &nbsp;&nbsp;WOULD never have believed that real
scouts could have failed so miserably in
a mere washing," complained Grace;
"in fact, I am almost wondering if we should
not go into ashes and broadcloth, and ask to be
trained laundresses. It seems to me rather
humiliating."</div>

<p>"Ashes and broadcloth," repeated Cleo
thoughtfully. "Oh, you mean sackcloth and
ashes. That's in a different department&mdash;Con
Grazia, also a different priced goods. But I
don't believe we need worry about the laundry
work. Mother thought we were perfectly
heroic to undertake the task, and she was
pleased to death to see the lines of sparkling
linens waving welcome to her as she hailed in
from the train. Also, she admitted the same
starch mistake we made, that of stiffening handkerchiefs
when she first tried out the process.
So perhaps that's a regular human weakness
and not peculiar to raw scouts, rookies, I suppose
I should say."</p>

<p>"I am so glad your mother approved, Cleo.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
I feel better now. I must confess I was rather
crestfallen after all our noble, heroic, spectacular
stunts. But sufficient unto the day is the
trouble thereof, as some one has remarked.
Now Cleo, I want to tell you something," and
she settled down deeper in the porch cushions
at "Rosabell." Also she kicked off a new pair
of pumps to remove pedal distractions. "You
know Cleo, I have heard that a lot of small fires
do start up mysteriously around here. And
no one has been able to run down the fire bug.
I heard some men down at the Post Office talking
about a run the fire department had last
night. Away out some place just for a chicken
coop. They seemed peeved, as Louise would
say. Now I feel we have a clue in that bottle
note, but after all our other experiences perhaps
it would be better for just you and me
to go at the mystery first. More hands always
seem to me like more mixups."</p>

<p>"Really, Grazia, you alarm me with your
wisdom," replied Cleo, affixing a very foolish
giggle to the alarm signal. "I just wonder
what will happen if you go getting so mighty
wise all of a sudden. But I do think you are
right just the same. Many hands mean mighty
mixups. That's alliteration. You see I'm
sticking to lit."</p>

<p>"I wish you would stick to common sense,
Cleo. I am not wishing any hard work on the
scouts for this glorious summer, but I feel, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
instinctively feel, as Julia says, there is something
queer to curiosity in the fire-bug business.
Also, I have found my old Jack Tar friend,
that I promised myself when we came down.
And he is captain of the Life Saving Station
just as I planned. Only&mdash;well&mdash;it really isn't
essential, but his whiskers are not quite as long
as I planned them to be. But Cleo, I want you
to meet old Neptune. His name is Dave Dunham,
and he seems to love me already. Come
on down and have a talk with him. He has a
place like a scene in an old fashioned drama."</p>

<p>"I'd love to go, Grace, and I am just keen
on an ocean breeze this A. M. So gather up
your pumps, also your feet, and let us away,"
decided Cleo.</p>

<p>The weather was still cool, and true to their
promise the girls were wearing their scout uniform,
all khaki, with the thin blouse, so that
running along to the life saving station they
seemed quite a part of the picture. The real
marine sky&mdash;that green blue with white clouds
as soft as the very foam they roll over, gave the
day a finish fit for the true artist's eye, but
Cleo and Grace did not stop to admire the tints
and tones, whether marine or general seascape.</p>

<p>"How cozy," whispered Cleo as they stepped
into the front room of the station, which was
fitted up with such comforts as might be essential
to the life of the Coast Guard. The big
round pot stove was obviously the most conspicuous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
thing in the room, and beside it such
furniture as the long table with its faded red
cover, the big wooden chairs, with bindings of
wires and telegraph glasses for castors (rheumatic
cures, we recall), all these articles fell
into the shadows of that big round stove, with
its new coat of shiny black iron paint.</p>

<p>"Captain Dave!" called Grace, after looking
about for the host. "Are you in?"</p>

<p>"Sure thing, I'm in, right here, comin'," returned
a voice which preceded the figure of
Captain Dave.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Captain," Grace greeted
him. "This is my chum, Cleo Harris, you remember
I spoke of her. We are all Girl Scouts,
you know," as he eyed the uniform and both
girls raised their hand in salute. "Maybe you
can give us something to do with all of your
life lines, and buoys and such things. We don't
know much about life saving on the deep, although
we have tried it on dry land," said
Grace.</p>

<p>"Welcome," said the old sailor simply.
"We don't have hard work this time of the year,
but we need the rest after winter. This was a
heavy one. More storms than in thirty years,"
he declared, pulling out two of the heavy wooden
chairs, running his hand over them to make
sure they were free from dust, then indicating
the girls should make themselves comfortable,
while he proceeded to occupy a still larger<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
chair that commanded a view of the sea from
the broad window.</p>

<p>"Captain, what do you think of all those
small fires we hear folks talking about?" asked
Grace in her direct way. "Do you suppose
some mischievous boys are starting them?"</p>

<p>The captain turned his head to the direction
in which he was emitting his clouds of smoke,
paused for a minute, then shook his head.</p>

<p>"I dunno," he replied. "I know most of the
youngsters around here, and I've never known
them to do a thing like that. There was seven
good hens burned in that little fire last night,
and old Dick Malloney has to depend on selling
eggs to get his coffee. It's a shame!" and
he allowed his heavy chair to spring forward
with a pronounced thud.</p>

<p>"We have only been down a week," remarked
Cleo, "but I have noticed smoke almost every
morning out in those woods over the river. I
suppose some one lives that way, do they?"</p>

<p>"You mean on the island," he explained.
"That's Weasle Point, sticks out into the bay
and just west is the island; not more than a
clump of trees on a few rocks, but big enough
to stand the wear, so it is called Luna Land, but
children make it Looney Land," he explained.
"A couple of huts in there, but no place for you
girls to go visitin'," he finished, as if divining
the plan already shaping itself in the minds
of Grace and Cleo&mdash;a trip to Looney Land.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why Looney Land?" asked Cleo. "Queer
folks out there?"</p>

<p>"Dunno as any folks is out there, but places
get named somehow, just like they get trees, no
plantin' just come that way. Looney Land
doesn't mean anything that I know of except
the moon seems to set over there. But one
thing I do know," and he made this very plain,
"it's a good place for girls to keep away from."</p>

<p>Grace and Cleo exchanged glances. It occurred
to each that the forbidden land was very
apt to become attractive, but neither said so,
nor asked how Looney Land was to be reached.</p>

<p>"You have awful storms in winter, don't
you?" asked Cleo, fingering an oil skin coat,
and noticing the big shiny hat that hung with
it on a wooden peg. "And I suppose you have
wrecks occasionally."</p>

<p>"Yes, more than we enjoy," replied Captain
Dave. "Had a bad one two years ago. See
that little pole stickin' up out there beyond the
pier? That's all that's left of the Alameda,
and a fine vessel she was, too."</p>

<p>"Lives lost?" asked Grace mechanically.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes indeed, yes indeed," replied the
captain. "Some folks around here yet that
was thrown ashore from that wreck. I mind
one light haired woman, and a youngster&mdash;little
girl. We took them in here from the
line, you know how we swing the rings out on
the line, and draw the poor things in? Well<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
this woman was so frozen we could hardly get
the child from her arms. She died next day,
just as we got her to the hospital."</p>

<p>"What was her name&mdash;the girl's name, I
mean?" asked Grace, interested now that
"life" had been discovered in the specter of
the wreck.</p>

<p>"Oh, some simple name&mdash;don't know as I
recall it rightly. They usually tag on another.
We have quite a few folks pass in and out of
this station in thirty years&mdash;I've been here
more than that, and I don't keep no record of
my visitors. They are mostly glad to come and
glad to go," and the captain lighted a fresh
pipe, by way of turning over a new leaf in his
story.</p>

<p>"I suppose there were the usual papers for
the little girl from the wreck," prompted Cleo.
"They always turn out to be somebody of account,
lost at sea and found years later on land.
You know how stories have a way of shaping
themselves, Captain," she apologized, "and I
am sort of interested in stories."</p>

<p>"You'll find plenty around here, without concocting
them," the seaman promised. "Not a
broken oar in that loft but is a record of some
boy's courage, and not a boat do we break up
for firewood but with it goes many a story of
heroism that never was printed," he added eloquently.</p>

<p>"And you think we ought to keep away from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Looney Land?" Cleo forced herself to ask, being
a trifle reticent about recalling the question
Captain Dave had so decisively spoken upon.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know as there's any great harm
in the little splash of an island," he replied.
"But when young 'uns keep saying 'look out'
and 'don't go near,' I allus' believe they know
what they're talking about. I hain't never
hearn any grown up say rightly the place is
pested, in any way, but the young 'uns just
naturally shuns it, and kids often make a
mighty good barometer&mdash;can tell when a gale is
brewin'."</p>

<p>At this the captain showed signs of having
some work to do, so the girls arose and thanked
him for his hospitality. They had enjoyed the
visit, and on leaving, captain Dave promised to
let them see a life drill some afternoon.</p>

<p>"Isn't that queer about Looney Island?"
asked Grace, directly they reached the board
walk. "Luna Land is a pretty enough name,
especially as Captain Dave says the moon sets
over there, but 'Looney Land' is different," she
declared. "We will surely have to explore
those parts, Cleo, even if we do have to take a
life saver's kit along with us."</p>

<p>"And did you notice Weasle Point? Of
course our fire-bug must belong somewhere out
in that sand-bar, and just as much of course, we
will have to find out all about the queer diggin's.
Better not tell Julie, she is so nervous, and I'm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
sure Margaret would want to fetch along our
only two town police officers, she is so practical.
There they are&mdash;the girls, I mean. See them
just turning around 'B' street? Coo-ee&mdash;Whoo-ee!"
called Cleo, her hand cupped to her
lips to send out the yodle.</p>

<p>Cutting across the little stretch of green that
bound Glimmer Lake, Margaret and Julia were
soon on the board walk.</p>

<p>"Oh listen!" shouted Julia. "Listen!" she
repeated in that useless way girls have of holding
off news.</p>

<p>"We are listening, of course," replied Grace,
"but get your breath or you'll choke. What's
the excitement!"</p>

<p>"That funny girl with the tongue," Margaret
managed to say, before Julia could get her
breath. "She's the queerest thing. She followed
us all the way from the village. We
turned corners, and so did she; we hurried, and
she hurried, and when we stopped, she stopped.
Isn't that too impudent for words? I think we
ought to report her," declared the indignant
Margaret.</p>

<p>"Report her for doing the things we do?"
laughed Cleo. "Why, Margaret, who would
think you were a first class scout? I'm surprised,"
and the girl's voice mimicked the severe
tones of a prim elder.</p>

<p>"Just the same," Julia insisted, "I can't see
why she should be allowed to plague us and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
molest us in the streets." Julia was not quite
sure "molest" was the word, but it had an important
sound and all the girls seemed impressed
by it.</p>

<p>"Aren't we special officers?" protested Grace.
"Why shouldn't we do our own&mdash;our own policing?
Let's form ourselves into a squad, and
track down the culprit," and she rolled her
tongue, as well as her eyes.</p>

<p>"Let us sit down and talk it over," suggested
practical Margaret. "I'm ready to drop from
all the paces we made samples of to suit our
trailer."</p>

<p>"Where did she go?" asked Cleo.</p>

<p>"Ducked into a little shanty with a laundry
sign on the fence," replied Julia, "and we were
so glad to be rid of her we just raced all the
way down B street."</p>

<p>"And look!" said Margaret. "There's our
other hero. The boy with the books. See, he
is making for a quiet bench, and look! That's
yellow paper sticking out of his pocket. Let's
watch him! Maybe he will get our bottle
letter."</p>

<p>But the studious boy with the books and
papers made straight for the bench, and finding
a seat proceeded to read. He didn't even
notice the girls when they brushed past him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>CRABS AND DISASTER</h3>


<div class='cap'>"ARE you perfectly sure it is safe?"
asked Cleo. "Seeing the bottom here
doesn't mean we can see it all the way
across."</div>

<p>"Why, you could walk across the river,
really," replied Louise. "Even at high tide
it's not more than a big pond."</p>

<p>"Oh, do come on," begged Grace. "Think of
catching crabs."</p>

<p>"But who knows how to row?" demanded
the cautious Cleo.</p>

<p>"I do!" called Margaret. "I always rowed
out in the pond at Flosston."</p>

<p>"And so do I," insisted Julia. "We go to
Lake George sometimes, and I have tried rowing
in the smaller streams there."</p>

<p>"And I have always known how to row," replied
Louise emphatically.</p>

<p>"That being the case I suppose I must make
the crabbing party unanimous," capitulated
Cleo, "although I should not enjoy a spill out
here so near the inlet."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>"We will go up stream, the other way," conceded
Louise, delighted at the prospect of their
crabbing party. "Come on, here is where we
hire our boat, and get our crabbing outfit."</p>

<p>Down to the landing that jutted out into the
shallow Round River, the girls hurried to procure
their fishing outfit.</p>

<p>"A flat bottomed boat," urged Cleo.</p>

<p>"All right," agreed Louise. "But any big
boat will do. There are four of us. One basket
and four poles," she ordered from the prim
little gray haired woman who kept the stand at
the landing.</p>

<p>"And bait," went on Louise, while the other
girls marveled at her marine intelligence.</p>

<p>"Oh, what smelly stuff?" sniffed Grace, taking
the basket and holding it out at arm's
length.</p>

<p>"That's the bait," explained Louise.</p>

<p>"I'm never going to eat fish as long as I
live," resolved Cleo. "Each time I meet it it
smells worse."</p>

<p>"The same fish naturally would," joked
Louise. "But this is only bait Cleo&mdash;bait,
don't you know what that means?" she teased,
swinging the obnoxious basket up to a line with
Cleo's face, where avoiding the odor would be
impossible.</p>

<p>A boy was unfastening their boat, and he
placed the oars in the locks just as the girls
reached the water's edge.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't tip," cautioned Julia. "We could at
least get wet, even in this shallow water."</p>

<p>Grace and Margaret took the oars, and soon
the crabbing party was gliding out among the
few vacationists who were taking advantage of
the pleasant afternoon on the water.</p>

<p>"Oh, look!" exclaimed Cleo. "There are
the crabs! Where's our bait and things?"</p>

<p>"We have to load up first," explained Louise,
assuming the role of fisherman. "Get your
lines out, look out! Don't tangle them."</p>

<p>"But how do we hook them?" asked Julia,
who was gingerly affixing an unfortunate little
"shiner" on her line, to serve as bait for the
foolish, greedy crab.</p>

<p>"We don't hook them, we catch them in the
nets," further explained Louise. "I came out
with daddy last week."</p>

<p>"Oh, no wonder you are so wise," said Cleo,
struggling with her line. "I simply couldn't
imagine what degree of scouting you learned to
fish in; because I didn't."</p>

<p>"We recall what a lovely time you had in
Allbright woods," Grace reminded Cleo. "But
then it was at cooking fish you especially qualified,"
she added referring to an incident related
in "The Girl Scout Pioneers."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. My explosive mud ball!" assented
Cleo. "But this is different. Ugh! I shall
never, never brag of clean hands again after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
this. There, my fish is tied on the sinker; now
what do I do, Weasie?"</p>

<p>"Don't rock the boat, that is always first and
last orders," replied her chum, "and next, just
throw your line out in any direction you
choose."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see. You just guess where the crabs
are," replied Cleo, quite interested, as her bait
was leaving port, so to speak. "There!
That's the best part of the fun&mdash;taking aim,"
and she gracefully tossed her flying line out into
the water.</p>

<p>The other girls had likewise "cast," and now
all were patiently waiting for a bite.</p>

<p>"Now, when you feel a pull," advised Louise,
"just bring it up and slip your net in quietly,
and scoop up Mr. Crab. There! I've got one!
Now watch!"</p>

<p>Just as she had ordered the others to do,
Louise now scooped up her net, and in came a
good sized blue crab.</p>

<p>"Oh, look out," cried Grace. "Crabs bite
fearfully. Louise, you are not going to turn
that thing loose in this little boat?" she wailed.</p>

<p>"Don't worry Grace; he goes right in his
little basket. There!" and with a skillful motion
Louise did turn the squirming shell fish
into the basket.</p>

<p>"He's crawling out!" shrieked Julia. "Oh,
we should have a cover for the basket."</p>

<p>"No," Margaret said, shaking the basket and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
thus settling the nervous crab. "He can't get
out. He is just exercising. My, how clawy he
is! How many like that would it take to make
a meal?"</p>

<p>"Quite a few I should think," replied Cleo.
"For I know we don't eat the shell. But this
is fun. Let me have another try. My turn to
land one now," and again she cast out and patiently
waited a bite.</p>

<p>The next shout of victory, however, came
from Julia's end of the boat, and she presently
landed a very large crab, so large and lively
in fact, that all four girls helped to get him in
the basket.</p>

<p>"Now, they'll fight," murmured Margaret.
"See the way they claw each other."</p>

<p>"Come on girls," called Louise. "We'll
never fill our baskets if we hold an autopsy
over every catch. Here! I've got another,"
and into the basket went another unfortunate.</p>

<p>"It's just like a game, and I think the chance
of grabbing one is as good fun as grabbing at
Cross Tag," Cleo remarked. "Oh, there's one,
Grace; look at your line dragging!"</p>

<p>And so it went on until the crabs were piling
up in the basket and threatening to get out, in
spite of the sea weed that was heaped on much
thicker than necessary, according to the opinion
of Louise.</p>

<p>So intent were the girls on their crabbing
game they had not noticed the other craft drifting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
about them. Suddenly Grace pulled so
hard at Cleo's sleeve she almost lost a catch in
the attempt.</p>

<p>"Look!" begged Grace. "Over in that
boat! Wise Willie, the boy with the book."</p>

<p>They all paused to observe the graceful green
bark, in which was seated the boy with the book,
as Grace described him. And as usual the book
was very much in evidence.</p>

<p>In fact, his oars lay in their locks, and he
was drifting aimlessly as if the river were his,
instead of the earth, according to Monte Cristo.</p>

<p>"Let's give him a scare and see if he is
alive," suggested Cleo.</p>

<p>"Suppose we row up to him and ask him
if he knows where the Weasle lives," proposed
Grace.</p>

<p>"Oh, please don't," implored Julia, who
showed signs of nervousness. "Why should
we disturb him&mdash;he's only reading?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you like Wise Willie," teased Margaret.
"Here's a flower from my belt, toss it to him,
Julia."</p>

<p>But in spite of their joking the boy in the
boat, all unconscious of the attention he was
the center of, merely drifted on, until first one
oar, then the other slipped out of the boat, and
floated down the river.</p>

<p>"I believe he <i>is</i> unconscious," Grace continued
to joke. "Now, of course, we have to
rescue his oars."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why?" asked Julia innocently.</p>

<p>"Or tow him in, if you would rather, Jule,"
suggested Louise. "Don't you realize we are
bound by traffic laws to assist a stranded boatman?"</p>

<p>"But he isn't stranded, and he doesn't need
help," replied Julia with a show of something
like temper. "Why should we speak to a
strange boy?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"And why shouldn't we?" fired back Cleo.
"If he isn't stranded it is because he hasn't
struck the strand yet; just watch him."</p>

<p>They dropped their nets and watched the boy,
who, bent over his book, drifted along without
the least sign of regard for his situation.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the oars had drifted farther and
farther away. A passing motor boat swelled
the tide to a current and this washed them
almost out of sight of the watchers.</p>

<p>"Being a boy we hesitate to hail him," said
Louise. "Now, if that were a girl&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, if it were," interrupted Julia, with a
meaning tone.</p>

<p>"All the same the poor boy may be late for
dinner," said Grace foolishly. "Let's hail
him!" and she cupped her hands to her lips.</p>

<p>"Please don't," begged Julia. This objection
brought forth a perfect volley of cynicism.</p>

<p>Finally, Cleo took up one oar, and Margaret
the other, and they proceeded in the direction
of the floating propellers. As they passed the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
boy's boat, the girls spoke loudly of "some one
losing his oars," but even this did not arouse
him.</p>

<p>"Maybe we'll have to row him home," said
Grace. "He doesn't look as if he cared much
whether he ever gets back to land or not."</p>

<p>It took but a few moments to get his oars,
and again the girls turned up stream.</p>

<p>"Who is going to give them to him," asked
Louise, with a foolish giggle.</p>

<p>"We are noble scouts&mdash;we are!" mocked
Cleo. "Mine be the task! A-hem!" and here
a fit of laughter spoiled the proposed effect.</p>

<p>"Here are your oars!" called Grace, before
the others could realize what she was about.
But no boy answered.</p>

<p>"Say!" yelled Margaret, taking courage
from Grace. "Say, boy! Here are your
oars!" Still no answer.</p>

<p>Louise took an oar and gave the drifting boat
a vigorous shove.</p>

<p>At this the boy did look up, and for a moment
he seemed to comprehend; then he jumped up
so suddenly he toppled over into the water between
the two boats!</p>

<p>"Oh, mercy!" cried the girls, in one voice.</p>

<p>"The river is deep enough here!" exclaimed
Louise. "Give him an oar to climb on."</p>

<p>A sudden scream from the boy in the water
brought the melancholy news that he could not
swim! His boat drifted off as quickly as it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
was freed from his weight, and the girls were
not quite near enough to reach him.</p>

<p>"Hurry, hurry!" begged Louise, who was
now rowing. "He may sink, then what would
he do?"</p>

<p>But the boy was splashing around making a
brave attempt to keep up, and really doing so
by the flat handed action with which he patted
the water.</p>

<p>All embarrassment was now forgotten, as the
scouts pulled up carefully to where the boy
was just bobbing up and down, each movement
adding to his peril.</p>

<p>"Climb in!" commanded Louise as they
reached him. But he could scarcely put his
hand to the oar, and the girls noticed his face
was blue white.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear me!" cried Julia, "he is fainting
or something," and nervous though she was,
it was she who managed to get the first grip
on the weakened boy.</p>

<p>It was no easy matter to get him into the
boat; he was struggling and gasping for breath,
and could make very little effort to help himself.
Finally, when all four girls had succeeded
in keeping the boat balanced and dragging him
into it, he gave one painful gasp, closed his
eyes, and sank into unconsciousness.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>A DIFFICULT SITUATION</h3>


<div class='cap'>"WHERE shall we take him?" asked
Grace in dismay.</div>

<p>"To the landing," replied Cleo, who
still rowed with Margaret, while Julia clung
to the stern of the boat in horror.</p>

<p>The boy looked so lifeless! Could he be
dead?</p>

<p>As he lay there his delicate features seemed
more than death-like; they seemed dead!</p>

<p>"Oh, mercy, do hurry!" pleaded Grace.
"Let me help you pull," she asked, getting hold
of Margaret's oar.</p>

<p>The small boat was now over crowded, and
it was with difficulty the girls managed to give
the boy sufficient room.</p>

<p>"Can't we call any one?" suggested Julia.</p>

<p>"Not any one in sight now," replied Louise.
"We spent more time than we imagined. See,
it is sun down."</p>

<p>"But what made him go like that?" Margaret
whispered. "He had only been in the
water a few minutes."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>"Maybe the fright," said Cleo, noticing how
high the lad's forehead was, and with what evident
care he had been dressed. His glasses
were still on, and the sunset made ghostly
shadows on his face.</p>

<p>"I'm so glad he didn't topple over when I
touched his boat," said Louise. "I should
have thought it all my fault, if he had."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," replied Grace. "He was bound
to fall overboard. He did not seem to know
he was on the water. But isn't it too bad there
is no one around to call? Every one is gone
now."</p>

<p>They rowed as vigorously as their young
arms could serve the strokes, and it took but
a few moments to get out in a straight line for
the pier.</p>

<p>As the girls came within hailing distance of
the dock the captain there, seeing something
was wrong, hurried to the steps to meet them.</p>

<p>"What's this? What happened?" he asked.</p>

<p>"He fell overboard. Oh, please hurry to revive
him," pleaded Julia. "He looks so death-like."</p>

<p>Leaning over the boat the man picked the
frail boy up in his arms and carried him up the
pier as quickly as it was <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'posible'">possible</ins> to do so.</p>

<p>"He moved. Look!" called Julia. "See, he
is moving! Oh, I am so glad he is not dead."</p>

<p>"He could hardly have died," replied Louise,
thus reassuring her nervous companions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
"Still, I am glad to see he does move. Do you
think we should follow them up there?"</p>

<p>"Oh, see the crowd gathering," exclaimed
Margaret. "We can't do anything to help.
Let's row out and bring in his boat. We
would attract a lot of foolish attention up
there."</p>

<p>This was considered the best plan, and without
being noticed the girls pulled out again, and
only watched the excitement from the distance.
Presently they heard an automobile start off
from the pier and at this the crowd was seen to
disperse.</p>

<p>"I guess they are taking him home in a car,"
said Cleo. "Dear me, do you suppose it was
our fault that he fell overboard?"</p>

<p>"Why, no indeed," protested Margaret.
"But we saved him. He might easily have been
lost if we hadn't. Somehow he seemed half
asleep. He might have really been sleeping.
Boys often do that while out rowing."</p>

<p>They managed to catch the drifting boat, and
Grace got in this to row. As she did so she
could not help observing a number of folded
slips of yellow paper that lay tossed aside,
in the bottom of the boat. But Grace had no
thought of scrutinizing them. Somehow such
an act would seem like spying.</p>

<p>Briskly both boats were now rowed back to
the landing. No one was near, and when the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
scouts turned in their oars and paid for their
boat, only a boy was at the stand.</p>

<p>"Was he hurt?" asked Cleo eagerly.</p>

<p>"Oh no, just scared. He's all right," replied
the boy handing out some change.</p>

<p>"Who is he?" asked Grace frankly.</p>

<p>"Oh, a chap that lives at the Point&mdash;don't
know his name. He's awful quiet and queer&mdash;just
reads his eyes out&mdash;no wonder he wears
goggles," finished the clerk, turning to pop a
soda for a waiting customer.</p>

<p>The girls breathed easier. Somehow they
were each conscious of a dread, and the boy's
report had dispelled it as if by magic.</p>

<p>"Oh, say!" he called after them as they were
moving away. "Are you the girls who rescued
him? Well, he especially warned me to get
your names?" This was in question.</p>

<p>"But we shouldn't like to have him bother
thanking us," returned Cleo, as spokesman.
"We only did a scout duty."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, that's so. You're scouts. Aren't
you? I'm a scout too, but we haven't any girls'
troop around here. Wish you would start
one."</p>

<p>"We may," assented Margaret. "But did
you talk to the boy after he revived? Was he
perfectly all right?" she questioned pointedly.</p>

<p>"Guess so, but he's a queer chap. Can't tell
whether he's all right or all wrong, he's such
a stick. Excuse me, here's where I sell a real<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
order," and he hurried over to an old lady who
was vainly trying to shut an obstinate parasol.</p>

<p>Again the girls turned away, and the clerk
had not fulfilled his promise to get their names;
neither had they obtained the name of the
stricken boy.</p>

<p>"But I feel a lot better," admitted Cleo.
"Somehow, it isn't nice to see a boy as still as
he was."</p>

<p>"I should say not," added Grace. "And I
couldn't help thinking of Benny. I've never
seen him still in his life, but I don't ever want
to see him as quiet as that. And say, girls&mdash;"
and she drew as many of them to her as her
arms would reach, "the bottom of that boat was
full of <i>yellow</i> paper rolls!"</p>

<p>"He couldn't be the fire-bug!" protested
Louise.</p>

<p>"I don't believe he could either," went on
Grace, now really serious. "But I thought I
ought to mention about the papers."</p>

<p>"And the boat man's boy said he lived over
on the island," mused Cleo. "I'm glad we got
out of leaving our names. He might come
around to thank us&mdash;and he might carry&mdash;a
torch!"</p>

<p>This sally revived the girls' spirits to the extent
of producing the first laugh they had enjoyed
since the accident; and to demonstrate
the possible torch bearing, Cleo paraded on
ahead with a long stick up-raised, while Grace<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
and Louise followed with the crabs squirming
in their basket.</p>

<p>"Now, we shall divide the spoils," said Margaret,
when the town was reached, and the
group should separate for their respective cottages.</p>

<p>"How many are there?" queried Cleo.</p>

<p>"Any one may have my share," offered Julia.
"I don't ever want to see a crab again as long
as I live," and her face fell to positive freezing
point.</p>

<p>"Now, Julie dear, don't take on so," teased
Grace. "No telling what our Wise Willie may
turn out to be, and just think&mdash;you held his foot
when we dragged him in."</p>

<p>"Grace, just you stop, I am nervous," pleaded
Julia, "and I didn't hold his foot, it was
his hand."</p>

<p>If Julia was really nervous, the laugh and
merry-making that followed her na&iuml;ve remark
must certainly have dispelled the quakes, for
presently she was shaking with laughter rather
than with nerves.</p>

<p>"But the crabs!" insisted Grace. "Let's
draw for them," and she dragged the girls over
to a little terrace where they unceremoniously
squatted down.</p>

<p>"Here are nice long and short straws," offered
Louise, breaking off some tall grass ends.
"Julia, you can say which wins, long or
short?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>"Please don't ask me to decide anything
about those crabs," protested Julia. "And if
you don't mind I'll just run along. Mother
expects folks to dinner. I had a lovely time&mdash;"
she stopped to allow the girls' laugh time to
penetrate. Force of habit in "having a good
time" seemed too absurd now, when all were
just recovering from the accident shock.</p>

<p>"Oh, we know what you mean, Julia," teased
Grace. "You had a lovely time holding Willie's
foot&mdash;hand I mean, I forgot it was his hand."</p>

<p>But Julia was off, down the avenue, her light
hair floating like a cloud about her shoulder,
and her slim figure&mdash;the girls called it svelt&mdash;still
proclaiming her the little girl, in spite of
her grown up manners. Every one liked Julia;
she was pensive and temperamental, but distinctively
individual withal.</p>

<p>"No use my winning those crabs," said Margaret,
"we haven't any one to shell them, or
cook them, or do anything with them."</p>

<p>"You can put them in a tub of water and
let them grow up," suggested Cleo, drawing a
long straw, when a short one would decide the
crabs.</p>

<p>"There, Louise, you have them. Take
them! I hope they make you a lovely salad,
and that they don't make you sick."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>AT WEASLE POINT</h3>


<div class='cap'>"ISN'T it queer how no one seems to know
any one else?" remarked Grace, with
more words than meaning.</div>

<p>"You mean every one seems a stranger to
every one else," added Cleo, affecting the same
ambiguity.</p>

<p>"Yes; to put it collectively, the whole town
is being populated by rank 'furriners,'" said
Louise, "but I can explain the analogy. You
see, when summer comes the natives pack up
and leave their homes to rent them profitably.
That means only the post-master, and store
keepers stay put."</p>

<p>"I have asked more questions and got fewer
answers since I came to Sea Crest than I would
have believed possible to ask and not receive,"
declared Cleo. "But what is your special
trouble, Grace?"</p>

<p>"I asked a couple of girls who our queer
Letty was and they didn't know. Now, they
were barefoot and peddling clams, the kind they
dig up in the sand, and does it seem possible
they would not know that girl?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>"They may come in from another town,"
suggested Louise. "It is quite possible they
wouldn't know a thing but clams. I have found
that out. But let's hurry off. I've got the
lunch, and we are not to go farther than the
Point. I have learned that girls go out there
with perfect safety, and there's a nice little ice
cream place tended by a perfectly prim, gray-haired
lady, who keeps an eye all over the
Point. It must be a very small point, or the
woman must have a long distance eye," finished
Louise.</p>

<p>"We are going in the launch, of course,"
asked and answered Cleo. "I had to assure
mother that the man who runs it has a brand
new license, and I almost promised to bring
back the number. Mother is so afraid of all
sorts of motors."</p>

<p>Ready for the excursion to Weasle Point,
Grace, Cleo, and Louise, garbed in their practical
scout uniforms and armed with fishing
rods and a lunch box, started off in time to take
the River Queen on its first trip of the afternoon.
A few other passengers embarked with
the girls; a mother with a small son and daughter,
two business men, and the boy with supplies
for the island fruit stand.</p>

<p>This number seemed to satisfy the captain
who, after counting heads, started off. Across
the river, then into the bay that widened as it
neared the ocean, the River Queen glided gracefully<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
over to the little strip of land jutting out,
with its clump of deep green pines, and the ever
present picnic sign.</p>

<p>"Isn't this lovely?" exclaimed Louise. "I
am so sorry Julia had to go to the city."</p>

<p>"And that Mary is not down yet," added
Cleo, "but we can come again. It's a perfectly
lovely sail."</p>

<p>Landing at the improvised dock the girls
quickly found the most secluded corner of the
little grove, and although they had lunched at
home, the sail was a potent appetizer, and the
proposed spread was eagerly arranged.</p>

<p>It was very quiet on the strip of sand selected
by the little party. Like a narrow ribbon the
Point lay on the waters, and the deeper woodlands
were evidently unpopular and little traversed,
for not even a path greeted the scouts
in their rambles.</p>

<p>"I wonder why the place is called Weasle
Point?" questioned Cleo. "Are we supposed
to hunt weasels out here?"</p>

<p>"I don't even know what the beast looks
like," replied Grace. "Are they bearish or
wolfish?"</p>

<p>"Neither, they are little snappy things that
eat birds," said Louise. "I've heard daddy
tell of them&mdash;he's quite a hunter, you know.
But I don't fancy we will be attacked."</p>

<p>They had disposed of their lunch, and were
exploring. All sorts of odd growing things<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
were discovered, from the almost invisible wintergreen,
that hugs the earth as if fearful of
standing alone, to the wide spreading sweet
fern, that lords it over every other green thing
under the trees.</p>

<p>More than once shouts of "Snake!" were
sent up, and each time this proved to be a false
alarm, or the snake must have made good its
escape, for no horrible crawling reptile came
to view, in spite of the most desperate thrashing
of bushes, and beating of brush, following
each alarm.</p>

<p>"Oh, see here!" called Louise, who had wandered
some distance from her companions.
"Here is the dearest little dove, eating our
lunch crumbs. He carried them out here to
safety."</p>

<p>Quietly the girls stole up to a pretty soft
spot in the thicket, and there found a little
pigeon enjoying the last crumbs of Cleo's cake.
Although the approach meant some more crackling
of leaves and sticks, the bird seemed not
the least disturbed, in fact, as the scouts looked
down he looked up with a perky twist of his
graceful throat.</p>

<p>"Must be tame," suggested Louise. "I hope
those children down by the water don't come
romping up to scare him off."</p>

<p>Cautiously Grace approached in that steady,
definite manner that always seems to mean still
motion. The bird hardly fluttered, but when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
the girl threw out a few more crumbs he
proudly hopped toward her.</p>

<p>"He has something tied to his leg," said
Grace, keeping her voice down to almost a murmur.
"I believe he is a carrier pigeon."</p>

<p>"Surely," agreed Louise, for the tiny speck
on the bird's leg was plainly an aluminum strip
such as marks the carrier bird.</p>

<p>The same thought flashed through the mind
of each&mdash;who would be sending private messages
through that grove!</p>

<p>"I suppose we wouldn't dare look at the
note," said Grace. "They are always in a
piece of gelatine under the wing."</p>

<p>"My, no," replied Cleo, "that would be
equivalent to robbing the mails."</p>

<p>"But this mail seems to want robbing," said
Louise quietly, "just see how he waits? Maybe
this is his station."</p>

<p>So intent were they on watching the dove
they did not hear an approaching step. It
came so stealthfully, creeping along the soft
marshy ground, scarcely a sound broke the
woodland stillness; only the voices of children
down at the landing, giving evidence of other
life than that of the Girl Scouts on the island.</p>

<p>"Oh see!" said Grace. "This leg is hurt.
Perhaps that is why he doesn't fly off," and
noticing for the first time that the bird hopped
on one slender leg, Grace stepped up nearer to
examine the injury. As she did a voice sounded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
just back of the group, and a very sharp
voice it was.</p>

<p>"Hey there! You leave that bird alone!"
came the shrill order.</p>

<p>Turning, they confronted the girl they had
privately named Letty.</p>

<p>"Oh, is he your bird?" asked Louise confidently.
"He seems to be injured, and we
thought we might help fix the injury."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you did," sneered the girl. "A
whole lot you thought that. Guess you had an
eye on Lovey's mail bag. Here Lovey!" she
sort of cooed to the bird. The change in her
voice was remarkable. It softened to a caress
as she stooped to pick up the little carrier
pigeon.</p>

<p>First she looked at the leg, which, it appeared,
had been hurt, but was mending. Assuring
herself this was all right the child perched the
bird on her shoulder and stood there a picture
for the eye of an artist.</p>

<p>Standing at a little distance the girls regarded
her cautiously. There she stood in her bare
feet, with a tattered dress, her hair cropped
out as if cut with a single snip of a powerful
scissors, and that pretty bird perched contentedly
on her shoulder!</p>

<p>After satisfying her inclination for this unconscious
pose, she cuddled the bird in the
crook of her arm, and again confronted the girls.</p>

<p>"You don't ever want to interfere with anything<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
around here," she warned, assuming
again the high pitched voice. "And if you
don't run away you might miss your boat."</p>

<p>"Oh, we wouldn't mind," Grace had courage
to say. "We are not afraid of the woods, and
it's early yet. There seem to be other people
here who have to get back to Sea Crest."</p>

<p>"Snoopin' eh?" sneered the girl again.
"Well, you want to watch out. You're the
smarties that tried to drown Bentley, ain't
you?"</p>

<p>"Who said we ever tried to drown any one?"
demanded Cleo, stepping up to the girl, whose
bare feet looked almost black, and whose short
hair stood around her face with the wildest effect&mdash;almost
Fiji, the girls thought.</p>

<p>"Well, I ain't saying Bentley did," she answered,
"but some one did, and you better be
gettin'."</p>

<p>"Seems to me you are not very polite," said
Louise. "Here we offer to help you fix up
your bird, and you try to chase us," she declared.
"Well, we are in no hurry, and don't
you go saying anything about us drowning
folks, do you hear?" and Louise surprised herself
with her courage. "We saved a boy from
drowning the other day, and were glad to do it,
but we had nothing to do with the accident, and
it won't be well for any one to spread malicious
reports about us either!"</p>

<p>Had the other scouts dared they would have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
applauded, but the occasion demanded different
tactics.</p>

<p>"Oh, ain't you smart! I suppose you're
scouts too, in them rigs. Maybe you'll go tattlin'
on me and try to have me 'pinched.' Well,
there ain't nobody 'round here dasts to touch
me, so you needn't bother."</p>

<p>"We had no idea of tattling on you, but it
seems you have taken a lot of trouble to bother
us, since we came," retorted Cleo.</p>

<p>"And you was down on the beach when the
barrel went off and burned some of the guards
things, wasn't you?" she went on, ignoring the
charge Cleo had made. "You know they're
after the firebug, an' you better watch out!"</p>

<p>This seemed too much. The girls fairly
fumed with indignation.</p>

<p>"Yes, we were down there, and nearly got
burned with the way that barrel went up," fired
back Grace as quickly as she could get her
breath, "but we don't know anything about the
firebug <i>yet</i>. But we are going to. Do you
know who the Weasle is?" she asked indignantly.</p>

<p>"The Weasle!" and the girl burst into a
choppy laugh. "Me, know who the Weasle
is?" she repeated again. "That's a good 'un.
Why don't you ask Bentley?" and before they
realized her intention she stooped for the empty
lunch box, and with her free hand threw it full
force at Louise's head. Dodging it Louise was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
ready to start after the creature, but before
she could do so they saw her reach the water's
edge, jump into a skiff and row swiftly away.</p>

<p>"Talk about cyclones," began Cleo, when she
had recovered from her surprise. "Whatever
do you call that human tornado?"</p>

<p>"We don't call her," replied Grace. "I just
think we ought to make a complaint about her.
Think of her saying we tried to drown a boy!"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you," said Louise soberly. "She
isn't right in her mind."</p>

<p>"But right enough to make a lot of trouble
for folks," retorted Cleo. "There she goes
now for Looney Point. Maybe that's what
Captain Dave warned us to keep clear of."</p>

<p>"Let's get down among the other people,"
suggested Grace. "It's a little too lonely up
here."</p>

<p>"And I guess we had better take the next
boat back," added Louise. "Something might
just happen that we would be left."</p>

<p>When they reached the dock the launch was
about ready to start, and piling in they soon
found themselves again facing Sea Crest Pier.</p>

<p>So the afternoon had been one of surprise
and disappointment.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>THE FIRE AT THE PIER</h3>


<div class='cap'>"WE must have a regular scout meeting,"
announced Cleo. "We may
get into trouble if we are not careful.
Grace, have you rounded up all the True
Treds?"</div>

<p>"I have," replied Grace, raising her finger
in salute to the emergency captain. "They'll
all be here at Rosabell, by eleven. And having
Mary and Helen will give us a small troop."</p>

<p>"That's splendid. Mary and Helen are
Tenderfoots, of course, but they know the
duties. I can scarcely believe that girl would
actually say the things we heard her say, and
then to throw that box at Louise!"</p>

<p>"Just the same as pulling faces at us the
first day we met her," said Grace. "I don't
feel we ought to take her seriously. But you
know there was another fire out Koto way last
night, and it spoiled some lovely trees. Father
says every one is so indignant about it, but
never a person is found around to give a clue to
the culprit."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>"And she insinuated that we made the beach
fire," said Cleo indignantly.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's pure nonsense, of course. But
did you see how she acted when we asked her
about the Weasle?"</p>

<p>"Yes, she knows about that note, I'm sure,"
said Cleo. "But then she thinks she knows a lot
of things. She certainly lives over on the
Island, and so she couldn't very well start fires
at night?"</p>

<p>"But she rows like an Indian. Here come
the girls. Now we will have a chance to talk it
all over."</p>

<p>The arrival of Helen, Mary, Louise, and Julia
completed the group, and presently a summer
session of the True Treds was under way.</p>

<p>To the newcomers at Sea Crest the whole
situation was explained, and nothing short of
consternation followed its recital.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say no one knows this girl?"
asked Helen.</p>

<p>"No one we can find," replied Louise. "You
see the whole town moves away when the summer
folks come, all but the cleaners and the
store keepers; and we didn't like to ask any
of them."</p>

<p>"I'm sure Captain Dave must know this
girl," declared Grace. "I'm going down to the
station this very afternoon and have a talk
with him."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>"Saw him go out to Brightwater in a motor
boat this morning," Louise said.</p>

<p>"Well, we simply have got to keep up our
troop tactics until we run this down," declared
Cleo. "Think of her saying we tried to drown
the boy!"</p>

<p>"And she called him Bentley. That's rather
a pretty name. He surely doesn't belong to her
class," said Grace.</p>

<p>"But he too is odd, we must admit," resumed
Louise, "and he had the very same kind of
paper we found in the bottle."</p>

<p>"And his boat was covered with it," added
Grace.</p>

<p>"But you really don't think he could be
malicious enough to start fires?" asked Julia.</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied Grace. "They always
say book-worms are queer, and surely he
is a book-worm, if there ever was one."</p>

<p>"I propose taking a trip to that Looney
Island," said Louise directly.</p>

<p>"I'd love to," followed Cleo; "but what
about Captain Dave's warning?"</p>

<p>"What did he say?" inquired Mary.</p>

<p>"Why, he told us this Luna Island or Looney
Land as the children call it, was a very good
place to keep away from."</p>

<p>"Did he say why?" asked Helen.</p>

<p>"No; just hinted that children always feared
to go over there, and he considers children the
natural judges of danger. We know better.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
Here we are mere kiddies, and we are not a bit
afraid," and she laughed at the idea.</p>

<p>"In fact, we are just dying to go. How do
you get there?" This from Margaret.</p>

<p>"Take the launch to the point, then hire a
boat and row over to the island. We saw 'the
girl' do it. It's only a short distance."</p>

<p>"Sounds alluring," said Mary, who was now
a splendidly healthy little girl, quite unlike the
timid creature discovered by the girls in our
second volume, "The Girl Scouts at Bellaire."</p>

<p>"You are almost chubby, Mary," remarked
Grace. "I suppose you had a wonderful winter
in the South with your folks."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, wonderful," replied Mary. "But I
would rather have been to school in New York
with you girls. Perhaps next fall I can enter
with you."</p>

<p>"So it is all decided," prompted Helen. "We
are to go to your Looney Land and capture the
lunes. I wonder if we had not better bring a
few brothers along?"</p>

<p>"As scouts we scorn a body guard!" replied
Louise, "although it might be well to leave a
lookout over at the point."</p>

<p>"When do we set out?" asked Julia, now as
keen as her companions on the perilous expedition.</p>

<p>"That must depend on the weather," said
Cleo. "We can't brave the waters with overhung<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
skies. If I'm not mistaken I hear thunder
this minute."</p>

<p>"Bring your wheels in," cautioned Grace.
"Benny will put them in the garage. There!
That surely sounded near by."</p>

<p>In the cyclonic way storms have of gathering
near the ocean, clouds tumbled over clouds,
piling mountains high, then dipping down in
veritable spouts ready to empty their weight
of water on the shrinking earth. The weather
had been just warm enough to precipitate this
sort of shower, and before the first drops fell
people scurried for shelter, deserting piers, and
board walk, as if swept away by the reckless
west wind.</p>

<p>The Girl Scouts stayed on the porch until the
lightning frightened them inside Rosabell cottage,
then from the windows watched the
vagaries of the summer storm.</p>

<p>A sudden blinding flash of lightning and its
immediate clap of thunder drove the girls from
the window.</p>

<p>"Oh!" shouted more than one. "Wasn't
that awful!"</p>

<p>"Listen!" as a gong sounded. "The fire
bell!" cried Grace. "Get your coats; see the
crowd over there! Let's run."</p>

<p>Without a thought of the down-pouring rain,
the Girl Scouts, garbed in such protective garments
as they could snatch from the clothes-tree
in the hall of Rosabell, raced over to cover<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
the short distance to the pavilion, where the
crowd was seen to gather from all directions.</p>

<p>"What was struck?" Cleo asked a boy, who
was trying to outdistance the bright red fire
engine.</p>

<p>"The pier, I guess," he replied, dashing on
merrily at the prospect of some real excitement.</p>

<p>A light film of smoke could now be seen
steaming up through the rain at the end of the
pier. But it was not likely a fire could make
much headway in that downpour. The girls
watched the rather primitive fire apparatus,
with keen interest. Crowds of boys, numbers
of men, and a scattering of girls and children,
made the scene quite a lively one, to say nothing
of the shouting of the volunteer firemen&mdash;the
only grade that is allowed to shout at a
fire. A line of hose was soon dragged out to
the end of the pier, and almost before the happy
urchins realized it the fire was out, back taps
sounded from the tower in the village, and the
fun was over.</p>

<p>After the crowd had dispersed and the shower
was entirely over, the girls walked down the
pier to inspect the damage. On one of the
benches near the end, an old man sat huddled
alone, his fishing rod was at his feet, and his
basket was beside him on the bench. As they
approached he stood up, then sank down again
unable to keep to his feet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>"He must have been out here when the
lightning struck," said Louise. "The poor old
man!"</p>

<p>They came up to him and he smiled feebly.</p>

<p>"That was a big shower," said Helen by way
of introduction.</p>

<p>"Mighty heavy, mighty heavy," he answered,
his words short and his voice very low.</p>

<p>"Were you out here then?" asked Grace,
beginning to realize that the old man must have
been stunned.</p>

<p>"Yes, and&mdash;it near&mdash;finished me," he replied,
again trying to stand but ending by sinking
back on the bench, heavier than before.</p>

<p>"Oh, you poor old man!" said Julia. "We
must help you home. Where do you live?"</p>

<p>"Couldn't help me home," he replied with a
sigh. "I have a long walk along the sand, and
then the boat. Don't see how I'm going to
make it though. That flash just did me up,"
and he stooped to gather his fishing things that
had evidently been scattered when the hose was
run down the pier.</p>

<p>"Where do you live?" again asked Louise.
"No matter how far away it is we can help you.
We can take you in a car."</p>

<p>"No cars go out that way," said the fisherman,
mistaking Louise's meaning.</p>

<p>"Oh, we mean in an automobile," she corrected.
"Let us see if you can't lean on some
of us while the others go for a car. We will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
be glad to help you," she insisted, feeling the
Girl Scout pledge surge over her.</p>

<p>It was quickly decided Grace should run for
her sister Leonore, to get their car out, as
Rosabell was the nearest cottage, and while she
hurried off with Helen, Cleo and Louise assisted
the old man to his feet. Meanwhile Mary and
Julia gathered up his fishing outfit.</p>

<p>He was old and feeble at best, but now, after
his fright and shock from the lightning, he
seemed leaden, as he leaned on Cleo from one
side, with Louise at the other.</p>

<p>Up the pier they led him, and at every step
he either sighed because he had lost his power
or blessed "the little girls who gave him a
hand." It seemed to the scouts rather odd that
no one had discovered his plight until they had
found him, but after all, it was not hard to
understand how an old fisherman could be overlooked
in the excitement.</p>

<p>Leonore had driven up with the car, and before
the stragglers around the pier could question
them, the girls had their charge in the comfortable
seat, where he lay back in very apparent
relief.</p>

<p>"Which way?" inquired the young girl
driving.</p>

<p>"To the river dock," called Grace; and all
crowded in the roomy car, they started off
with their strange passenger.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>PLANNING FOR ACTION</h3>


<div class='cap'>"NOW, don't trouble another bit," protested
the old man when Leonore pulled
into the little boat landing. "I'll take
the next boat across, and be all right, thank you
for helping me. You're a fine set of girls."</div>

<p>From the time they had left Borden's pier
the girls had been tactfully trying to find out
where he lived, and why they couldn't drive
him directly to his place. But to all their inquiries
he answered evasively, and was most
positive in declaring they could not fetch him
home.</p>

<p>"But you are scarcely able to walk," protested
Helen. "Why won't you let us drive
around there with you? You know this car can
easily cover that distance in a few minutes."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry to seem ungrateful," he replied,
and the girls noticed his voice was almost
sobbing. "But I can't let you do it."</p>

<p>"And you live on that Luna Island?" queried
Grace gently.</p>

<p>"I do, worse luck," he answered. "But we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
must take things as they come. There's Jenning's
boat. He'll bring me across."</p>

<p>They reluctantly assisted the aged passenger
to alight and watched him climb into the rain-soaked
launch. He stumbled and almost fell into
the seat under the dripping canopy. Captain
Jennings propped the leather cushions under
his sagging arms, and as the girls turned away
from the landing they heard the motor of the
River Queen chug out.</p>

<p>"No wonder they call that place over there
Looney Land," remarked Julia. "It seems to
me we are all meeting more of its loons every
day."</p>

<p>"We have come across quite a few," admitted
Cleo. "But this old man was nice; I liked
him."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you ask him for a pass to the
island then?" remarked Louise. "That still
seems to be forbidden territory."</p>

<p>"Yes, something like 'No Man's Land'. But
did any one ever hear of 'No Scout's Land?'
That's the beauty of belonging to a privileged
organization."</p>

<p>"Queer thing how every one warns us to
keep away from there," said Julia. "Every one
but Bentley. Wonder what he would say if we
asked him for a pass!"</p>

<p>"That's a brilliant idea, Julie," declared
Margaret. "The very thing to do is to ask
Ben."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>"I knew that boy's name ought to be something
with Ben in it," remarked Grace. "I
seemed to outline it in his face when he reminded
me of my own wild, but adorable little
brother Ben. Of course, we never see our own
boys down here except at meals, or we might
get them to help us."</p>

<p>"We don't even get ours at meals," said
Helen. "Mother says we might better all be
in a hotel or boarding house, for all the home
life we get out of our cottage."</p>

<p>"Let's stop at our place and finish up our
scout meeting," suggested Cleo. "The storm
sort of broke up our session."</p>

<p>So Leonore accommodatingly let them down
in front of the Log Cabin, and on the spacious
rustic porch there the interrupted meeting was
again convened.</p>

<p>"Grace, if you are going to act as secretary,
I think you should keep records. When our
summer is over we shall enjoy looking back at
them."</p>

<p>"All right," agreed Grace, preparing pencil
and pad for notes.</p>

<p>"We must remember," cautioned Margaret,
"that we are pledged to protect ourselves as
well as others. Now, how do we know it is safe
to go to that island? Suppose there is some
disease there?"</p>

<p>"We must find out more definitely about that,
of course," spoke up Mary, who was now a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
professed Tenderfoot. "It would be rash to
run into some dreadful sickness."</p>

<p>"Also, we must question our motives and
make sure we are not doing this out of rank
curiosity," declared Louise sagely. "That
would be silly, even if pardonable, and I don't
think we could make a very creditable report to
headquarters on such a pretense."</p>

<p>"Oh, that is clear enough," insisted Cleo. "It
is just this way. We were confronted by this
fire-bug thing, directly we struck the place, and
its evidence has been piling up ever since.
Every few nights a fire breaks out&mdash;and no
one is able to discover the culprit."</p>

<p>"And that note we found was a challenge.
It was written for who ever might pick it up,
and we happened to be the 'whoevers'" said
Louise. "So it plainly seems like our duty to
run down the Weasle."</p>

<p>"But just why would you think the writer was
on the island?" asked Helen, who, having come
down late was not entirely familiar with all the
details of the situation.</p>

<p>"We haven't any positive reason for that
supposition," admitted Margaret; "but things
point that way, and we must run down that clue
first. Besides, it is very strange how every
one warns us to keep away from Luna Land.
It makes it fascinating, to say the least."</p>

<p>"Almost a good reason for going," remarked
Mary. "And now girls, will you come over to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
the hotel this evening, if you are free from
other engagements? We are going to have a
children's entertainment in the ball room, and
I would love to have every one come."</p>

<p>"But our dresses?" asked Grace. "What
should we wear?"</p>

<p>"It's a novelty thing, and you can wear whatever
you please," answered Mary.</p>

<p>"How about all going as a troop? We would
advertise the scouts, and it's lovely and cool
now after that shower."</p>

<p>"Oh, that would be splendid!" enthused
Mary. "Since all the war work has moved off
the earth nothing seems to have really taken
the uniform's place. And as you say, it will be
wonderfully cool to-night."</p>

<p>"And another positive advantage to uniform
is that one can't out-do the other in togs. I love
that," declared Helen, "although we all have
pretty party dresses."</p>

<p>So the True Treds scattered, keen with the
anticipation of novelty night at the Colonade.</p>

<p>It is safe to guess that in the short time intervening
there was much activity in each scout's
home, in the matter of pressing uniforms, for
even "going as a troop" would mean public
inspection. Yet this amount of work was comparatively
small compared with what might
have been their task had dancing dresses been
demanded.</p>

<p>Into the gold and white ball-room of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
Colonade the True Treds were ushered with
quite an imposing ceremony a few hours later;
and if Grace and Cleo wanted to giggle, the
pomposity of the uniformed functionaries forbade
any such frivolity.</p>

<p>Mary was there to welcome them, and with
her was her fashionable aunt, Miss Constance
Hastings, who was also distantly related to
Cleo, through the marriage of Cleo's aunt to
Mary's father's brother&mdash;remote but definite,
just the same.</p>

<p>A perceptible stir was occasioned by the
entrance of the girls; and since they were really
quite a small troop, they walked in in pairs.
Grace and Cleo led, then came Margaret and
Louise, Julia and Helen, besides Isabel Gantor
and Elizabeth Bissell, two True Treds who had
come down that very afternoon, and altogether
they made a fine showing for the scouts.</p>

<p>After the first flush of excitement the usual
exchange of compliments occupied the girls.
Cleo had grown so much taller, every one
thought so, and her gray eyes and fair hair
were really "a lot prettier." Grace had better
be careful or she would get stout, why not
roll on the beach every day? Elizabeth suggested
this, while the tables were then turned
on Elizabeth herself, who was declared to be
far from thin.</p>

<p>"I am not getting fat," declared the jolly
little Elizabeth. "I'm simply warped from being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
out in the rain. You should see my farm."</p>

<p>Then Helen was warned that such beautiful
coloring as glowed in her cheeks, and such
shadows as lurked under her dark eyes would
some day put her in the class of distinguished
foreigners, but when she protested that Irish
are not so considered, and that those characteristics
were hers because of that sort of connection,
the girls passed her by as "satisfactory."</p>

<p>The opening strains of the orchestra prohibited
further exchange of compliments or
criticism, and the scouts paired off for a lively
trot.</p>

<p>All the dance seemed suited to their uniforms,
in fact, most steps were then executed
with some precision, rather military in effect.</p>

<p>All about them buzzed the fairy-like children
in such gorgeous styles, as seem specially concocted
for big summer hotels; and resting between
dances our girls had plenty of opportunity
to observe the variety of plumage under
which the little summer birds flew.</p>

<p>It was during intermission that the master
of ceremonies approached Isabel; she happened
to be the tallest of the scouts, and he
asked her if they would favor the company with
some troop man&oelig;uvers, but on consulting the
other girls they declined to do so.</p>

<p>"You see," Mary explained, as she was best
acquainted with the hotel staff, "we could not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
do anything in public as a troop without permission.
And while this is almost a private
gathering, we feel it best to adhere to the
rules."</p>

<p>"Still it was flattering to be asked," commented
Cleo.</p>

<p>"Let's go out on the porch," suggested
Mary. "We will have a beautiful view of the
ocean to-night."</p>

<p>But it so happened that something else than
the scenic effect entertained them, on the
spacious side porch of the Colonade that evening.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>AT THE COLONADE</h3>


<div class='cap'>THEY felt quite like grown-ups out there
in the moonlight, on the carpeted piazzas,
with the music from the ballroom wafting
out through the many open windows.</div>

<p>Here and there in sheltered nooks, knots of
young folks buzzed their confidences, while the
scouts chose two long, low divans, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'diectly'">directly</ins> off
the exchange, where they might at once enjoy
the music of the waves and the rhythm of the
orchestra.</p>

<p>It all seemed too pleasant to mar with ordinary
conversation, so holding hands as girls
will, the companions sank down to enjoy the
wonderful summer night.</p>

<p>They were not more than settled when two
young men sauntered out of the smoking room
and took the seat just back of their divan. The
girls nudged each other, and squeezed hands,
but did not emit the usual warning cough.</p>

<p>"Well, I am glad to hear from Dick," spoke
one of the men; "I tell you, he did great work
in our little old war."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>"You-bet-y'u," replied the second voice,
slurring his words together as young men do,
and giving them that jolly twang peculiar to the
college boy.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, Dick Gordon is some boy, and I'll
be mighty glad to see him."</p>

<p>Grace almost pinched Cleo's arm to the yelling
point. "That's my Jackie&mdash;the one who
owns my marine room," she said in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Keep your window locked," cautioned Cleo.</p>

<p>"And he's still on the blue?" went on the
masculine voice.</p>

<p>"Still is&mdash;you-bet-cha," replied his companion.
"Regular Willie off the yacht, only
he's bound to be Richard on the yacht. Seems
some millionaire family he knew&mdash;there may be
a girl in it&mdash;prevailed on him to take a yacht
out this summer, so he's sailing her&mdash;the yacht
I mean; I'm only guessing at the girl."</p>

<p>Isabel coughed audibly. It was just like her
to do so and she either had to cough or laugh,
and she hastily decided on expressing herself
in the least conspicuous outburst.</p>

<p>For a few minutes the young men ceased
speaking, and in the interval the girls undertook
to carry on something like a conversation;
at least they were endeavoring to make their
presence known to the other occupants of that
corner of the porch.</p>

<p>Thus establishing a general hum of voices,
remarks from the young men only floated in as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
the girls might pause, or giggle, or hesitate
about staying longer from the dance floor.</p>

<p>"So old Dick will be back before summer
sundown?" they heard.</p>

<p>"Sure thing, you bet'cha," replied the second
voice, "and we'll all be here to give the
cheers."</p>

<p>"But the Gordon place is rented. Wonder
what Dick will do without all his junk?"</p>

<p>"That's so. Well, we can bring him here.
All the gang will be back by that time."</p>

<p>"Heard when and where he comes in?"</p>

<p>"Depends upon the yachters, of course. But
Dick said something about a lady's good health
or bad health, I forgot which."</p>

<p>A bevy of young ladies now discovered the
youths who had been thus enjoying a smoke and
talk, and the boys were promptly carried off to
the ball room, where the strains of an alluring
waltz were floating.</p>

<p>"Now Gracie, see what's going to happen?"
exclaimed Louise, as soon as talking thus was
safe. "Your adorable Dick of the marine room
is coming back on a yacht, and he's going to
miss his junk."</p>

<p>"And maybe he'll give us a sail on the
millionaire's yacht!" suggested Grace.</p>

<p>"See that it includes every True Tred.
There, I believe the grown-ups are breaking in
on our evening," complained Mary. "Let's
make a march out of that waltz."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't you have wonderful times here,
Mary?" asked Grace, entering the brilliant
room again.</p>

<p>"Yes, but I can't say that I like it better than
a simple home life," replied Mary. "We travel
so much, and it's hotel all the time&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you are going to spend next week with
me," interrupted Cleo. "I hardly realize it
yet that you are my really truly coz," and she
gave the girl's long, brown braids a familiar
twerk.</p>

<p>"Whatever did you do with old Reda?" asked
Grace, referring to the picturesque nurse who
played so important a part in our second
volume, "The Girl Scouts of Bellaire."</p>

<p>"Daddy made her comfortable for life," replied
Mary. "He considered she had done
everything that she know how to do for me, and
mother's folks decided she would be happier
among her own people. But Aunt Constance
asked me to bring you up to her sitting room
to-night, and as soon as you have had enough
of this, suppose we go up?"</p>

<p>It was well the sitting room was spacious, for
the scouts numbered quite a company. However
the wealthy Miss Hastings greeted them
warmly, and seemed greatly interested in their
organization.</p>

<p>"I can never forget how you discovered our
little Mary for us," she said, placing her hand
lovingly on Mary's shoulder, "and if ever I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
can do anything to help you, please let me
know. It is splendid to have girls united under
such principles. Mary has charmed me with
her interpretations of your little manual."</p>

<p>They thanked Miss Hastings for her interest,
and smiled over the compliments. The girls
were quite bewildered with the luxurious surroundings.
Everything seemed so velvety, and
so much cushioned, and all this was enhanced
by the soft glitter of the shaded lights, and the
rose-tinted glow of the color scheme. Here, at
least, scout uniform seemed out of place.</p>

<p>Miss Hastings was what we might discreetly
call a mellow blonde, not implying or imputing
anything artificial to her blondness. She had
the very softest blue eyes, and wore the daintiest
orchid tint gown; but in spite of her apparent
luxury, she instantly inspired the girls with a
feeling of ease and confidence.</p>

<p>Mary fluttered about, displaying such trophies
of her southern tour as might safely be carried
to her hotel abode; and when the sight-seeing
was done, Cleo exacted a promise from Miss
Hastings, that Mary might spend a complete
week with her.</p>

<p>This was the signal for a perfect flood of
similar invitations, and when the girls left the
suite, their evening dance cards were well
marked with dates to visit and dates to entertain
Mary Dunbar, Cleo's popular cousin.</p>

<p>"What worries me is that Dick boy coming<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
over in the yacht," remarked Isabel jokingly.
"Seems to me Grace is in for a wonderful
time."</p>

<p>"But he may be on shore leave," added Julia,
"then he wouldn't be any more attractive than
our 'you-bet-chu' chap," she said, indicating the
young man who inserted that boyish expression
so often in his conversation.</p>

<p>The children were leaving the ballroom when
the scouts took their final drink of pink lemonade,
as Grace insisted on calling the fruit punch,
and as they came out to the porch for their
"good-nights," mothers and nurses were gathering
the fluttering little ones to their arms.</p>

<p>They were about to leave when a shrill voice
from the hall startled every one, "Oh, come
quick, a doctor! My baby is choking!"</p>

<p>A mother uttered the cry. In an instant every
one was in confusion looking for a doctor, but
it so happened in all that big hotel at the moment
no physician could be found.</p>

<p>"What shall I do!" wailed the mother, now
wringing her hands and begging for help. "I
don't know how&mdash;to save&mdash;my darling!"</p>

<p>Quick as a flash Julia broke away through the
crowd and, followed by Louise and Helen, she
made her way to the room of the distracted
parent and the suffering child.</p>

<p>On the bed lay the little child, gasping, choking,
his face almost purple. No one had attempted
to do anything but look on in horror,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
as people usually do under such exciting conditions.</p>

<p>Julia, however, summoned all her courage and
her scout training, and grabbing the little one
before she had a chance to suffer from hesitation,
she held his little heels high as she could
stretch them, and shook him vigorously, while
the distracted mother looked on in consternation.
When the Girl Scout's strength failed,
and she allowed the child to sink down on the
bed again, the safety pin, he had almost swallowed,
lay beside him on the coverlet.</p>

<p>It was all over in so few minutes that Louise
and Helen merely looked on to encourage Julia.</p>

<p>"Oh, my darling, my darling!" wailed the
excited mother. "Are you alive? Does he
breathe?"</p>

<p>"He will be all right directly," said Helen,
surprising herself with her own calmness. "Just
give him plenty of air."</p>

<p>By now those who had assembled in idle
curiosity had dispersed, leaving room for the
other scouts to come within sight of the open
door.</p>

<p>Quickly as the chubby youngster recovered his
breath he made a grab at the neck tie that
floated from Julia's blouse. Then he wanted to
play with the buttons on her skirt, and he
evinced such other evidence of good fellowship
that every one stood by in silent admiration.</p>

<p>The mother, however, had recovered her composure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
sufficiently to thank Julia; and this she
did most profusely.</p>

<p>"What would I have done?" she asked. "I
simply went to pieces, in a perfect panic, when
I saw that boy choke. Oh, here is Neal," turning
to greet a young man who just entered the
room. "Neal, do come and meet these wonderful
little girls. They saved the baby brother.
In another moment, I am sure, he would have
strangled."</p>

<p>And before them stood one of the young men
who had entertained them unawares on the
West porch, an hour earlier. He added his
thanks to those of his mother, while the baby
brother kicked delightedly on the badly tossed
bed.</p>

<p>"And you knew more about it than mother,"
he remarked, a note of incredulity in his voice.
"But I see you are scouts. They teach you
emergency stunts in your organization, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Julia covered with confusion
and anxious to escape; and escape she did directly
the good-looking Neal stepped aside, and
bowed the girls graciously into the corridor.</p>

<p>"I almost choked myself," admitted Louise.</p>

<p>"I will do so yet," declared Helen.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>ON THE SANDS</h3>


<div class='cap'>"AS a quiet evening it was a cyclone," said
Julia to her congratulating companions.
"I really was not sure whether I should
shake both the heels at once, or in rapid succession,
but when I saw that safety pin&mdash;oh, girls!"
and she pretended to slink down into the supporting
arms offered her.</div>

<p>"Whether premeditated or a mere accident
you did nobly," declared Margaret, "and I
shouldn't wonder if handsome young Neal
wouldn't want to join our troop. Isn't he
stunning looking?"</p>

<p>"But he is the friend of marine Richard&mdash;he
who is coming in on the millionaire's yacht,"
put in Grace. "Therefore Julia, you and I shall
divide the honors. Joking aside girls, what is
our program for the morrow?"</p>

<p>"Bathing, of course&mdash;high tide at ten-thirty,"
announced Julia.</p>

<p>"After that we will pay a call at Captain
Dave's Life Saving Station," said Cleo. "In
fact we can run over there from the beach. We<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
have simply got to find out all he knows about
Luna Island."</p>

<p>They were on their way home from the
Colonade, and as it was still early, the streets
were populated with summer visitors just leaving
the pavilions, the boardwalks, picture
theaters, or hotels. Each scout leaving the
group left one less to the usual "last tag" game,
which again became of interest to the young
girls, not yet too dignified to enjoy such pleasure
romps.</p>

<p>Next morning at the beach a number of new
arrivals were added to the list of their companions,
as each day now brought its own
quota of visitors to the popular summer resort,
and it was surely "the more the merrier."</p>

<p>"Good swimming in the cove," announced
Cleo, "at least we call it the cove, but it's really
a little lake, made smooth by the banked up
sand bar. Come on everybody, up to Third
Avenue."</p>

<p>Surf boards added to the sport, and while
every morning was a holiday at the beach, to-day
seemed something of legal type; such a
wonderfully merry time the colonists were enjoying.
All the scouts were swimmers; Grace
as usual was daring to the point of risk, Cleo
quickly followed every prank she initiated, and
the others found plenty of fun either attempting
to follow, or originating their own brand of
frolic.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>What is more alluring than the ocean on the
right sort of summer day? Beyond the bar
steamers could just be seen emitting their long,
smoky ribbons over the water, that from the
distance seemed so close to the sky as to be
merely a first floor with that blue mottled ceiling.
A few daring swimmers would work their
way out in canoes, taking the rollers at constant
risk of submersion, then come sailing in like a
shot, never making a break in the dash until past
the bathers, and out on the very beach each little
bark would triumphantly land. This was great
sport, but few girls were brave enough to indulge
in it.</p>

<p>The life savers, two stalwart youths, so
bronzed as to glisten in the sun like copper
models&mdash;sat on the high bench under the big
beach sunshade. They could see above the
heads of the crowds, far out past the danger
line, and theirs was the responsibility of keeping
track of every foolish boy, or more foolish
girl, who ventured beyond the ropes.</p>

<p>At last the scouts did get together, and made
a run through the wet sand, along the edge toward
the fishing pier, and from there it was
only a matter of crossing the street to reach the
life saving station.</p>

<p>In a trot, popular as exercise after bathing,
all four girls, Louise, Grace, Cleo and Julia
started off. The far end of the bathing beach
was now deserted, the hour approaching lunch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
or dinner always exacting the dressing process,
hotel guests especially, being obliged to report
in the dining-room on time.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, wait a minute," begged Cleo.
"I thought I saw a piece of pink coral."</p>

<p>"Pink coral doesn't grow around here," protested
Grace. "You likely saw a blushing fish
bone. Don't bother with it. You know how we
made out with the pink crabs."</p>

<p>"Yes," put in Julia. "Let's change our color
scheme. Here's a lovely amethyst shell."</p>

<p>The trot was started up again, heads erect,
shoulders back, and elbows in&mdash;regular
marathon for the beach on this perfect summer's
day.</p>

<p>"Look here!" called Cleo. "Here's another
message about&mdash;fire-bugs. See it spells:
'L-O-O-K O-U-T'" she figured it out in the
sand. "There, would you ever think one would
be so daring?"</p>

<p>They all paused to read the letters so crudely
forked in the wet sand.</p>

<p>"Yes," insisted Julia. "There's 'bug.'
Guess they didn't dare write the word 'fire'."</p>

<p>A lone figure on a lone bench up near the
boardwalk attracted their attention at the same
moment.</p>

<p>"If there isn't our boy!" exclaimed Louise.
"Now, doesn't that almost prove him guilty?"</p>

<p>"No, it doesn't," objected his champion,
Grace. "He's too far away&mdash;besides&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>"Any one could make letters in the sand,"
put in Julia. "Think of the hundreds of children
who played here all morning. Come on,"
and she started the race again.</p>

<p>But they had scarcely gone a hundred yards
when she stopped very suddenly.</p>

<p>"Oh, mercy!" she screamed. "I stepped
on&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You bet you did! You stepped on me!"</p>

<p>The answer came from a grotesque figure that
had just pulled itself out of the sand, and it was
none other than the girl, still known only as
"Letty."</p>

<p>"I didn't mean to," apologized Julia, for, as
a matter of fact, she had come full weight on
the sand hill under which was buried the girl.</p>

<p>"Well, you didn't break any bones," said the
girl, with less antagonism than she had formerly
displayed. "But I thought the sky fell&mdash;guess
I was dreaming."</p>

<p>She dragged herself up and shook the sand
from her unkempt skirt, although the action
seemed unnecessary, then grinned at the girls
in the most comic way.</p>

<p>This was a signal for Grace to howl, and
howl she did, to be followed by the others,
every one seeming glad that Letty had not
"thrown her head at them," as was her usual
attitude in meeting the scouts.</p>

<p>"And you go swimmin' in there?" she asked,
pointing a mocking finger at the ocean.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>"Surely, don't you?" asked Louise.</p>

<p>"Me? Well, I guess not. No more ocean for
Kitty," and she turned her back to the waves,
meanwhile pulling a long, wry face.</p>

<p>"Are you Kitty?" asked Cleo.</p>

<p>"Yep, that's me. They call me Kitty Scuttle,
but Scuttle ain't my name. Boys give me that
'cause I shoo them off the island."</p>

<p>Here was an opening. Louise seized it.</p>

<p>"Sit down and tell us about it, Kitty," she
said. "You know we really had no idea of
bothering your dove the other day. Did his leg
fix up all right?"</p>

<p>"Guess so, but he ain't my bird," and she did
actually flop down in the sand, much to their
surprise.</p>

<p>"Why don't you like the ocean?" asked
Grace.</p>

<p>"The ocean is a coward. It fights women and
babies," she said, a queer mocking irony marking
her words.</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Louise, to placate her, "the
ocean is treacherous."</p>

<p>"An' cruel," she sort of hissed. "I came
from that ocean on a rope once, and I'll never
go back on it while I'm alive."</p>

<p>"Oh, you were shipwrecked," ventured Cleo,
her mind running to the story of the little girl
on the frozen mother's breast, told them by
Captain Dave.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, Mom never spoke to me again, and I
hate that ocean ever since."</p>

<p>The girls exchanged glances. Surely she
must be the one spoken of by Captain Dave.</p>

<p>"But you like still-water?" suggested Grace,
in order to relieve the tension.</p>

<p>"Love the little Round River, Glimmer Lake,
and even the bay," replied Kitty, "but not that
monster."</p>

<p>It seemed to the scouts she used a queer mixture
of phrases. Cleo thought she might be
addicted to reading sensational books.</p>

<p>"Do you go to school?" queried Julia.</p>

<p>"Sure, every one has to go to school, and I
don't stay on the island in winter." This last
was said in a tone implying every one ought to
know that.</p>

<p>"You come over here in winter?" It was
Louise who dared press that question. They
all felt Kitty was due to take another tantrum
any minute. She had been almost dangerously
good, so far.</p>

<p>"Yep," the finality of this spoke for itself.</p>

<p>"We're just going over to the life saving station
to see Captain Dave," said Cleo. "Glad
we didn't hurt you as we ran."</p>

<p>"Couldn't," said Kitty. "I don't hurt.
Nothin' touches me. And say, I wasn't mad
when I pegged the box at you the other day. I
was just funnin'."</p>

<p>"You didn't hurt me either," returned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Louise, quite as good-naturedly. "A little pasteboard
box couldn't hurt a scout."</p>

<p>"Do you belong to the government?" asked
Kitty suddenly.</p>

<p>"We're not enlisted, if that's what you
mean," answered Cleo, "but we learn to give
service if it is needed."</p>

<p>"I'd like a suit like yours. Must be fine for
fogs. Sometimes I can't get into my rags
they're so soggy over there in the woods."</p>

<p>Every one silently agreed such clothes as she
possessed would surely become "soggy" under
the trees.</p>

<p>"But only a scout can wear the uniform,"
said Grace, being careful to use a very kindly
tone.</p>

<p>"What do you have to do?" inquired Kitty,
evincing interest.</p>

<p>"When we meet you again we'll tell you
about it," replied Louise. "But, say Kitty, we
want to take a trip over to the island some day.
Shall we see you over there?"</p>

<p>"To the island!" she shouted, and all her
gentleness was gone instantly. "Don't you
dare; the dogs would eat you up!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, we don't mind dogs," Cleo hurried
to say. "Besides, you must know them and you
could keep them in check."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, I couldn't," she was plainly excited
now. "Don't you dare come over to Looney
Land. The reason I liked you was on account of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
you fetching Uncle Pete up from the pier. He
told me, and I was&mdash;thankful."</p>

<p>She hung her head and her cropped hair stood
out like a brush around her face. Kitty was a
pathetic sight, even when excited.</p>

<p>"Was he your uncle? Is he all right?" asked
Louise.</p>

<p>"Nope. He isn't all right. Can't hardly stir
ever since. He said he would have died if you
girls hadn't helped him, and I want to thank
you for that. I'd just die without Uncle Pete."</p>

<p>"Well, good-by," said Julia, as they started
off this time positively. "Tell Uncle Pete we
will come over to see him soon."</p>

<p>At this the child ran over to Louise and
literally grabbed her, seizing her two hands,
and holding them as tightly as her own could
grasp them.</p>

<p>"Oh, please, please don't come!" she begged,
and her eyes had the look of a frightened
animal. "You don't know what it would mean
to me. And I ask you not to. Won't you
promise?"</p>

<p>The girls looked at the changed creature in
undisguised astonishment.</p>

<p>"We don't want to bring trouble on you,
Kitty, if that is what you mean," said Julia.
"But we have promised ourselves a trip to that
queer island. Of course, if it would hurt you
for us to go&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, it would, that's it. It would hurt me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
more than you could guess. So tell me you won't
come over!"</p>

<p>"All right, we'll see," said Cleo, and they
hurried off to the bathing house to dress, as the
time for visiting Captain Dave had been consumed
in talking to Kitty.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you think of that?" almost
gasped Cleo when they joined the other girls
who had been impatiently waiting for the report
from the life saving station.</p>

<p>"Whatever is wrong about Luna Land?"
added Louise. "Now see where we are at."</p>

<p>"Can't we go?" pouted Grace.</p>

<p>"I don't see why not," put in Julia. "Surely,
we couldn't make any trouble, just by going
over there. I think that girl is&mdash;woozy."</p>

<p>"Well, I think she's pretty sharp," said Cleo,
"and until we can find out from some one what
is wrong over there, I'll vote to defer the trip.
Suppose we really should bring trouble on that
poor cropped head!"</p>

<p>"That's so," agreed Grace, though it was
plain the change in plans brought disappointment
to the entire group. "Let's hurry. We
must have talked half an hour. And I promised
not to be one minute late for lunch."</p>

<p>"We have such a time with meals&mdash;never can
get folks together," said Cleo, hastily jumping
in to her blouse and skirt.</p>

<p>"All the same," insisted Margaret, "we must
go to the life saving station right after lunch."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>"And how about our tennis game? We promised
Mary, you know, to go over for a couple of
sets this afternoon."</p>

<p>"We never seem to get to tennis," deplored
Louise. "But let's all meet at Borden's at two
o'clock, and then we can decide what to do."</p>

<p>"There's Leonore looking for me," called out
Grace.</p>

<p>"And there's Jerry looking for me," added
Cleo.</p>

<p>"Come on girls, pile in, plenty of room,"
called Gerald; and those who did not run to
his car flocked to the one driven by Leonore, so
that the belated scouts made good time, then at
least, in getting to their respective cottages.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>A BLANKET OF FOG</h3>


<div class='cap'>THE genuine good times of summer, such
as seem to sprout up daily and scatter
enough seeds to insure an equal good
time on the morrow, had given the scouts such
a round of gayety, that a full week dashed by
before they could again settle down to work on
the mystery of Luna Land.</div>

<p>Girls coming down to the beach from the city,
others leaving for the mountains, a round of
cottage entertaining, besides events at the
casino, swimming contests, hotel entertainments&mdash;all
these and many other features,
served to keep the girls delightfully busy at the
gay little summer resort, Sea Crest.</p>

<p>But in spite of such attraction a rainy spell
will set in, and set in it did, good and plenty,
along about the middle of July. Then it was
that the resources of cottage and hotel were
taxed to keep the visitors contented.</p>

<p>Mary, at the Colonade, had been a veritable
benefactress, for there something was always
going on; but Miss Constance Hastings found<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
she could not stand the damp chill of continued
rain and heavy fog, so quite unexpectedly she
"pulled up stakes," and as Mary would not
think of letting her go on to Tuxedo alone, there
was suddenly one True Tred less at Sea Crest.</p>

<p>"What would we do without the life saving
station and Captain Dave?" Grace asked,
trudging along through the dense fog, toward
those quarters. "Come along Weasie, I wouldn't
wonder but Helen and Julia will come in from
the other way. Do you suppose the sun will
ever shine again?"</p>

<p>"Bound to," replied Louise, "but this awful
fog!"</p>

<p>"My conscience is mildewed and my temper
is blue molded," declared Grace. "Just look
at what used to be the ocean."</p>

<p>"Come on over to the pier," suggested
Louise. "I love to watch the breakers tear up
against the piles."</p>

<p>The boardwalk was all but deserted, not more
than the heroic health seekers who walk in all
kinds of weather, having courage enough to
promenade.</p>

<p>Under the shelter of the pavilion the girls
stopped to see if any one they knew might be
about, when a figure under an umbrella, far
over in a corner protected from the blanket of
fog, caught their attention.</p>

<p>"The boy!" said Grace. "Let's go over and
speak to him."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>"He might get stage fright and again jump
overboard," laughingly returned Louise.</p>

<p>"Any port in a storm," quoted Grace. "If I
don't talk to some one I'll just have to ring
myself up on the telephone. I'm dark blue."</p>

<p>"Nice compliment to your chum," remarked
Louise, smiling good-naturedly.</p>

<p>"You know I didn't mean it that way, Weasie.
But honestly, why is everything so horrid?"</p>

<p>"Guess because we are used to so much excitement
we don't know how to slow down. At
least that's what mother is always preaching."</p>

<p>"See, he looks! He sees!" gasped Grace, her
voice not so blue or drab in tone as might have
been expected.</p>

<p>The boy had lowered his umbrella, and
touched his cap to the girls. He even smiled.</p>

<p>"Is it possible? At last!" Grace continued
to elocute. "Now just watch me bring him to
my feet."</p>

<p>She seized the arm of Louise and led her to
the corner where the boy, as ever, was trying
to devour his book. At their approach he
quickly closed the covers, jammed papers in his
pockets, and then waited to speak to the girls
who had dragged him out of Round River a
month before.</p>

<p>"Hello," he greeted them, and both were glad
he was boyish enough to be frank, and not stiff.</p>

<p>"Wonderful day," Grace chirped in with
banality.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>"If you don't care what you say," he replied
brightly.</p>

<p>"But we do, so we'll tell the truth. It's an
awful day," declared Louise.</p>

<p>"Don't try to sit here," the boy said. He had
risen, of course. "The benches are wet enough
to float me as the river did. Come over to the
other end. The wind doesn't drive the fog in
there."</p>

<p>Louise and Grace followed him, glad of the
prospect of a little chat to break the storm's
monotony.</p>

<p>"I've been wanting to thank you," began the
boy. "My name is Bentley Arnold."</p>

<p>"And this Louise Hart and I am Grace
Philow," cut in Grace politely.</p>

<p>The boy did not bow or scrape foolishly, but
accepted the introduction as any boy should.</p>

<p>In the West corner of the pavilion they found
seats, and quickly exhausting the weather topic,
drifted to more interesting subjects.</p>

<p>"Did I hear that you live on the island?"
asked Grace directly.</p>

<p>"Not exactly," replied Bentley, "but I am
staying there just at present."</p>

<p>Not another word! That lead was lost!</p>

<p>"You are awfully fond of reading, aren't
you?" Louise asked next.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, very. Aren't you?"</p>

<p>And the book question was thus threatened to
go the way of Grace's query.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," Louise hurried. "What sort
of books do you like best?"</p>

<p>"Boys' books, and I suppose you like girls'
books best," he replied.</p>

<p>Grace and Louise exchanged glances. Each
was, no doubt, thinking they might next ask
what shade of paper he liked to write on best.
The reply would likely be quite as non-committal.</p>

<p>"How can we get over to the island?" Grace
dared then. "We are just dying to explore that
little Luna Land. It seems so romantic."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't advise you to visit there just
now," he replied. "Nothing to see but woods,
and rocks."</p>

<p>"Yet every one who goes over there seems so&mdash;so
selfish about the woods and rocks, they
keep telling us to stay away." Louise said this
pleasantly enough, but she did <i>say</i> it, nevertheless.</p>

<p>"Oh, it isn't that," he replied, his tone completely
wiping out the possibility of any one
being selfish about the island.</p>

<p>"What is it then?" asked Grace bravely.</p>

<p>"Well," he faltered, "you see some of the
people over there just think they own the place,
and they're queer about strangers."</p>

<p>"Does Kitty feel that way?" pressed Louise.</p>

<p>"Kitty?" he repeated. "Do you know her?"</p>

<p>"Yes, a little. But she never would tell us a
thing about Luna Land, except to keep away
from it." Grace contributed this effort.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>"She's queer but not really dishonest," he
said valiantly. "I'm getting to understand her
better."</p>

<p>"So are we," and Louise could not suppress
a real laugh at the memory of Kitty's various
stages of friendship, or at least of her acquaintance.</p>

<p>Louise tried another tack. "Do you get books
from the library?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, I don't have time for library books,"
replied Bentley. "Wish I had."</p>

<p>"I suppose you know a lot of boys here&mdash;are
you a scout? We are Girl Scouts you know,"
volunteered Grace.</p>

<p>"No, to all three questions," he answered.
But as usual he did not amplify his brief statement.</p>

<p>"There are Julia and Helen," announced
Louise gayly. But the advance of the two other
girls seemed a signal for Bentley to leave, and
this he did, sliding into the ice-cream parlor
before Julia and Helen reached their chums.</p>

<p>"Oh, you missed it," called Louise.</p>

<p>"We have met him," followed Grace.</p>

<p>"Did he invite you over?" asked Julia.</p>

<p>"Can he really talk?" inquired Helen.</p>

<p>"Just the same he is a nice boy," Grace declared.</p>

<p>"We always knew that," Julia told her.</p>

<p>"But, no joking, what did he say?" Helen
asked seriously.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let me see! What did he say?" Grace was
now asking Louise.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't tease. You know what we want to
know," pleaded Julia.</p>

<p>"We don't know what <i>you</i> want to know,
neither do we know what <i>we</i> want to know, for
we couldn't find out," replied Louise promptly.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say he didn't tell you a
thing?" and Helen showed disappointment.</p>

<p>"We wouldn't go so far as that, but he did
not tell us anything interesting, if that is what
you mean," said Grace. "But do come and sit
down, we don't dare follow him inside the
store."</p>

<p>"He's gone. I saw him steering his umbrella
due north a moment ago," said Louise. "But,
girls, really he is the nicest chap."</p>

<p>Then followed a complete review, almost word
for word of the conversation held with Bentley
Arnold. Yet even this brought the quartette
no evident satisfaction.</p>

<p>"If this fog lets up I'm going over there, if
I have to pay twenty-five dollars for a sail in the
South Park Air Ship. I know it came down
with a bad bump the other day, but I'd risk it
for a sail to Luna Land," declared Grace.</p>

<p>"Let's go over to Captain Dave's now," said
Helen. "He is the most entertaining gentleman
I know for this sort of weather."</p>

<p>"We found Bentley all right," qualified<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Louise. "And think of the name: Bentley
Arnold!"</p>

<p>"Did he say anything about his income tax?"
asked Helen, but for an answer the jaunt up the
fog-laden boardwalk was undertaken, and only
those who have ever indulged in real mid-summer
fogs, could really appreciate description,
and such do not need it&mdash;they know!</p>

<p>Captain Dave was glad to see the girls. He
lighted the big oil lamp and even offered to
burn papers in the stove to "kill the chill," but
the girls insisted they would be perfectly comfortable
without the heat.</p>

<p>"And Captain Dave, do you know about
Kitty?" Grace plunged quickly as politeness
would permit.</p>

<p>"Know Kitty? Well, I should, seein' as how
I unclasped her from her dead mother's arms,"
replied the seaman, almost reverently.</p>

<p>"Then, Captain," this very gently from
Louise, "why don't you do something for the
child? She runs wild as an Indian."</p>

<p>"Do something for her," and he dumped out
a pipe full of good tobacco. "Why, what could
I do?"</p>

<p>"Does any one take care of her? Has she
any friends?" inquired Helen kindly.</p>

<p>"Too many. That's just the trouble," and he
filled his pipe with new tobacco. "You know
that nobody's business is everybody's business,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
and that's what's the matter with poor little
Kitty."</p>

<p>The girls did not quite understand the
description, but the captain seemed troubled,
so they hesitated about pressing more pointed
questions.</p>

<p>"She is not half as wild as she seems," said
Julia after a time. "We had quite a jolly little
chat with her one day."</p>

<p>"You did now? That's fine!" he answered
heartily. "I wish you could see her once in a
while. She needs the right sort of friends.
What's a girl to do when every other girl in
the village shuns her?"</p>

<p>"We would all be very glad to talk to her
and make real friends with her," insisted Helen.</p>

<p>"I'm sure you would, for you're girls
brought up to be kind and friendly," said Captain
Dave. "I've heard how you befriended
old Peter."</p>

<p>"Oh, that wasn't anything," Julia interrupted.
"We only took him in from the
storm."</p>

<p>"Queer thing none of our firemen happened
to see him! And old Pete out there fishin'!
Why, he was so stunned, Kitty told me next day
he couldn't move," said Captain Dave.</p>

<p>"We thought we would have lots wilder experiences
down here than just driving nice old
men home, Captain," complained Grace.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>"Aren't you ever going to let us try your
breeches buoy?"</p>

<p>"Try it? What would you do with a breeches
buoy?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Have a lovely ride in it, wouldn't we?"
said Grace.</p>

<p>"I hope not," replied the captain seriously.
"That's not a thing to play with."</p>

<p>"And Kitty is the little girl you told us
about? She whom you took from the wreck of
the Alameda?" asked Louise.</p>

<p>"Yes, she is Kitty Schulkill, but they've nicknamed
her Kitty Scuttle, 'count of the way she
scuttles about so. But I thought when she was
taken over to the Point she might quiet down
some, but Kitty is Kitty just the same," he
concluded rather gloomily.</p>

<p>"Has she any relatives?" inquired Julia.</p>

<p>"Claims to be, one woman there, a high
falootin dame, claims to be her guardeen," he
said, using the quaint old way of pronouncing
the last word. "But I'm not sure. Don't know
as I just like her any too&mdash;well." And again
the pipe suffered from suppressed emotion.</p>

<p>They were making some progress&mdash;all the
girls felt keenly interested, and even a little
bit excited.</p>

<p>"Does this woman live with her at the
Point?" ventured Grace.</p>

<p>"Oh, to be sure&mdash;she runs the Point, from all
I hear," he replied. "But as I told you first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
thing, that Point is al'lus a pesky place and a
good place to veer from."</p>

<p>Confronted again with this thread-bare opposition
to a visit at the Point, the girls looked
discouraged.</p>

<p>"But you would like us to be friendly with
Kitty. How can we become acquainted with her
if we are not to&mdash;go&mdash;to her home?" Grace
blurted out finally.</p>

<p>The <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Captian'">Captain</ins> shook his head. "I'll tell you,"
he began. "This fancy dressed woman, from
what I hear from Kitty, is a queer case, and
for a short time it seems best to humor her.
Let her try it, I says when Kitty told me&mdash;but
I wouldn't say positive I like the scheme."</p>

<p>"Is that why you don't want us to go over
to the island?" asked Louise. Her voice was
gentle and she looked at the old sea captain
with an apology in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Now, see here, little girls," he answered;
"you have almost thrown old Dave off his
course. I don't know enough about the Point
to speak of it. I'm tied here, like the 'Boy on
the Burnin' Deck,' and when I do leave quarters
it is al'lus on government business. So
don't take too seriously what I say, except this&mdash;keep
off Luna Land, and don't pester little
Kitty."</p>

<p>And with that admonition they felt obliged to
feign content.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>ABOARD THE BLOWELL</h3>


<div class='cap'>"NOW we know what the fog was for," exclaimed
Cleo. "To show us how a good
clear day can look, that's why a fog is a
fog," she stated emphatically.</div>

<p>The day was perfect, and perhaps more conspicuously
so by contrast with the long spell
of damp just lifted. Activities that had been
suppressed were now springing into life, like
emotional mushrooms, and the True Treds
were markedly busy, trying to fit all the good
times into an over-crowded program.</p>

<p>Cleo and Grace were making a week's schedule.
This had been altered so often, Grace proposed
following Margaret's plan of "fun-by-the-day."</p>

<p>"No matter how carefully we arrange it,"
she protested to Cleo on the porch of the Log
Cabin, "some of the girls insist on crowding in
other things. Now, to-day we were to go canoeing,
and here comes Julia, telephoning to every
one of us to go sailing in a sail boat."</p>

<p>"I think that's lovely of Julia," said Cleo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>,
"because Grazia dear, we can go canoeing any
day, but only sailing when some one asks us.
Who did?"</p>

<p>"Julia's cousins from Breakentake sailed
down the bay early this morning&mdash;it must have
been a very early start. They are going to
stay over, and Julia says if the wind is right,
we may all go out for the afternoon. Of course,
it's a lovely prospect, but what's the use of
making plans? Why not just grab them?"</p>

<p>Grace had ridden over on her bicycle, and
the exercise furnished her a wonderful beautifier&mdash;had
she real need of the process. Eyes
shining, cheeks glowing, with almost dewy softness
of color, even Cleo, ordinarily indifferent
to temperamental changes, commented on her
chum's appearance.</p>

<p>"I do believe, Grace," she remarked, "the
dampness is good for the complexion. You're
as downy as a peach."</p>

<p>"Dampness is a beautifier. Leonore says so.
That's what makes Newport so popular. Ever
see the hydrangeas grow there? But Cleo dear,
you haven't been forgotten in the fog. You are
rather peachy yourself."</p>

<p>"Nay, nay, false friend. Tempt me not&mdash;I
shall not desert the ranks for movies," and Cleo
struck one of her popular attitudes. "But
about the sailing ship-ahoy! I'm ready. What
time do we embark?"</p>

<p>"Julia will call us all up after lunch when she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
gets a line on the wind. I believe it has to be in
'on high' to get us up the bay. All right," and
Grace mounted her wheel. "We will all be
ready, and hereafter little Captain, count me
out on the program cards. They do better when
left to the inspirational, as our own Captain
Clark would say."</p>

<p>To be able to learn, to be elastic to the point
of flexibility, is surely the secret of all progress,
and these girls of True Tred had little need of
such a lesson.</p>

<p>The Blowell stood straining at its cable at
Round River dock when the scouts, numbering
a troop, scampered aboard. Julia's cousins,
Mae and Eugenia Westbrook, prided themselves
on their nautical skill, and nothing could
possibly be more promising for a day's sport
than a sail on the Blowell.</p>

<p>"Scouts! Scouts! Rah, rah, rah!"</p>

<p>"True-Treds! True-Treds&mdash;Sis-boom ma!"</p>

<p>They shouted the call till every last one had
climbed into the "pit" of the graceful sailing
vessel, and like a sturdy strong crew they appeared;
the scouts in their <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'realiable'">reliable</ins> khaki, and
the captain and mate in their shining white
duck, with the regulation yachting cap, jauntily
but securely set on their capable heads.</p>

<p>From the tips of the mast "Old Glory" floated
to the stiff breeze, the ceremony of raising the
colors having been complied with according to
Girl Scout formality. Cleo, as acting captain,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
pulled the slender rope, while the girls stood at
attention and in salute.</p>

<p>"You may float the boat flag now," said Captain
Mae. "Be sure you adjust it right side
up."</p>

<p>Grace leaned over the stern to affix the little
marine emblem in its place, and soon the sail
swung out on its halyard, and when the mate,
Eugenia, cut loose from shore, the Blowell lost
no time in demonstrating the power of its name.</p>

<p>"Oh, how delightful," gasped Margaret.
"And we thought canoeing was fun."</p>

<p>"It's just glorious," exhaled Julia. "Now,
aren't you glad I changed our plans?"</p>

<p>"Tickled to pieces," declared Cleo. "I think
this is the only worthwhile sort of airship because
it combines the beauty of air and water."</p>

<p>They were seated in the trunk cabin watching
with deep interest Captain Mae as she set
the sail, letting it out gradually as it took the
wind, but being careful not to throw too much
canvass in the face of the stiff breeze that
seemed to sweep from the deep azure sky, as if
glad of its own release after the long spell of
hateful weather.</p>

<p>Mae was at the tiller guiding the steering
gear to fix the vessel in its course, on the
smooth, blue waters.</p>

<p>For some time the handling of the craft occupied
the visitors' entire attention, but presently
they undertook to move around.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>"This is where the Blowell beats your Indian
Queen canoe, Louise," said Cleo. "You can
move here without upsetting."</p>

<p>"But we <i>could</i> really upset in this boat,"
Louise reminded them. "Although, I am not
fearing any such catastrophe."</p>

<p>"Isn't it invigorating," Margaret added to
the continuous praise song. "I like the life of
this motion, yet it hasn't the least spilly effect."</p>

<p>Thus they enthused until shore points of
interest broke in on the marine eulogy.</p>

<p>"Just see us leave Weasle Point behind," remarked
Cleo, with a rather prolonged look at
the green speck as it drifted away.</p>

<p>"Wonder if Kitty is over there?" said Grace.</p>

<p>"And Bentley," added Julia, not to deprive
her chums of their usual joke that she never forgot
Bentley.</p>

<p>"And my Uncle Pete," insisted Grace. "Do
you know, girls, Captain Dave says he was seriously
stunned by that storm?"</p>

<p>"Poor old man! And to think we can't even
bring him a thermos of chicken broth," deplored
Louise.</p>

<p>The sail boat was gliding over the water,
proudly as the clouds themselves drifted overhead.
The Westbrook girls were allowing their
visitors full scope of the graceful craft, but objected
definitely to Grace taking a ride in the
little dory that raced behind. Grace thought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
such a feat would be a genuine lark, but Captain
Mae reminded her that the Sandy Hook Bay
was not the placid little Glimmer Lake she had
been accustomed to sporting upon.</p>

<p>Down in the cabin a real tea was served at
four o'clock, and if automobiling is conducive
to real appetites, sailing leads to the port of
hunger-pangs; and as an alleviative Orange
Pekoe, cheese, cookies, lettuce sandwiches, with
peanut butter and other conserves, can be
heartily recommended, according to the Log of
the Blowell, as inscribed that day by the True
Treds.</p>

<p>"All hands on the deck," ordered Cleo, in
mock severity, when cracker tins and tea cups
were being worked to the point of refined
cruelty.</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir," replied Grace, being first to
reach deck.</p>

<p>"Shall we sing 'Starboard watch ahoy!' or
'Little Jack'?" Margaret asked.</p>

<p>"No, let's sing 'Sailing!'" suggested Julia.</p>

<p>"Who knows any of the words?" inquired
Louise. "The title sounds appropriate, but it
would take more words to fill out a tune!"</p>

<p>"Starboard watch ahoy! Starboard watch
ahoy! And who can feel-e-e-eel, while on the
blue the vessel ke-e-ell." This was Cleo's contribution
done in all sharps, and as Louise
warned them, the title wouldn't do for a girl-sized
song.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, that's too old," objected Helen. "It's
out of print. Try 'Sailing.'"</p>

<p>"Sailing, sailing over the stormy sea,"</p>

<p>"The second line is just the same and ought
to end in B"</p>

<p>"Full many a stormy wind shall blow o-o-oh
when"</p>

<p>"Jack comes home&mdash;again!"</p>

<p>Thus ended Helen, and as a song "Sailing"
was considered a first-rate joke.</p>

<p>"Now," said Margaret, in a plain everyday
speaking voice, "I'm not going to spoil my
'Little Jack,' with any such parody as that. I'm
going to recite him."</p>

<p>"Hear! Hear!" ordered Captain Mae.</p>

<p>"I'm not sure I can recall all of it, but it's a
pretty story&mdash;so&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, Margy, a story is better than a song,
tell it," begged Louise, settling down deeper in
the leather cushions.</p>

<p>"But I may have to hum it, to get in rhyme,"
soliloquized the narrator.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's better still," cut in Cleo. "Give
us the hum."</p>

<p>"Do be quiet, girls, or we will get neither song
nor hum nor story," said Helen. "Go ahead,
Margaret. Tell it your own way, as they say
in court trials."</p>

<p>Again Margaret was directed to take up her
Little Jack.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>"It begins by calling the mates to come
around-around-around&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The hearth," suggested Julia.</p>

<p>"Hearth on the sea!" cried Margaret in
scorn.</p>

<p>"I'll fine the next girl who interrupts," announced
Captain Mae. "Go on, Maggie."</p>

<p>"I'll skip the introduction, I have to," Margaret
admitted, struggling with a laugh, "but
I know these lines:</p>

<p>"It was on the Spanish Main&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"And in a night of rain&mdash;then I have to skip
again, but you will understand the story,"
braved Margaret. "The sailors saw something,
I just have to insert that clause," she contributed,
"then it goes:</p>

<div class='center'><b>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</b></div>

<div class='poem'>
"So far from any coast, we thought it was a ghost,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And lowers a boat to see what it might be,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Where on its mother's breast a little one did rest,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The mother dead&mdash;the babe alive and well!"</span><br />
</div>

<div class='center'><b>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</b></div>

<p>"Oh, just like Kitty's story," interrupted
Cleo in spite of orders.</p>

<p>"Certainly, that's the reason I'm suffering so
to tell it," admitted Margaret.</p>

<p>"Does the song say what they did with the
little one?" asked Julia, always intensely sympathetic.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, listen," again ordered Margaret. "The
story tells:</p>

<p>"Now we're a rough old set, some are fathers, don't forget,"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but I can't think of that line, I should
have told you 'Our skipper seized the boy, and
kisses him with joy&mdash;&mdash;'"</p>

<p>This was almost the end for Margaret, if not
the end of the song, for they all seized the girl
and smothered her with kisses.</p>

<p>"But it was a lovely story, Margy, if bald in
spots," commented Cleo. "What's the
chorus?"</p>

<p>Again Margaret started, this time in tune:</p>

<div class='center'><b>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</b></div>


<div class='poem'>
"Singing eylie&mdash;heevie ho!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Eylie heevie ho!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Send the wheel around say we!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">While gayly blows the breeze,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">That takes us o'er the seas!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Singing eylie, heevie, eylie heevie ho!"</span><br />
</div>

<div class='center'><b>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</b></div>


<p>"Hurrah! Hurray! Hurroo!" called Louise.
"That's all right for a sea story, Margaret, and
we'll have to make a line of it in our Log. But
poor little Kitty didn't fare so well. See it was
a boy, 'they kissed him with joy,'" she explained.
"Being a girl poor Kitty was just dumped."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, one more line," persisted Margaret:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then we names him Little Jack, and kissing
he don't lack!"</p>

<p>Needless to say what happened to Margaret
at that!</p>

<p>Then, to give the Westbrook girls the full
benefit of their information, the story of Kitty
was told in detail, and even these young ladies
confessed to a keen interest in the mystery of
Luna Land.</p>

<p>"We must make a landing, and spend an hour
in the woods before returning," suggested
Eugenia as they skirted the shore.</p>

<p>"There's a beautiful rocky point, Mae. We
can easily sail in the cove, and let the girls
scamper around there."</p>

<p>And this was the plan immediately decided
upon.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>STRANDED</h3>


<div class='cap'>TIME flew as the girls scampered over
rocks, slid down sandy slopes, and otherwise
"explored" the picturesque retreat.</div>

<p>No accident marred the afternoon, beyond the
unexpected slide of Cleo, who, venturing too
near the edge, came down to the water's brink
by way of a sliding, sandy trail.</p>

<p>Everybody had been in wading, choosing a
shallow pool that trickled in from the bay and
hid behind a wall of sand, now plainly marked,
as the tide was receding.</p>

<p>"Come, girls, we must be moving," warned
Mae, "a sail boat depends on wind and tide
for safe navigation."</p>

<p>Reluctantly they left the sand, for this strip
of rocky woods was attractive to the point of
positive fascination.</p>

<p>With a friendly breeze they were soon under
full sail again, and the voyage home promised
too prompt an ending to their day's sport. They
would have prolonged it.</p>

<p>"Couldn't we sail in and out that group of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
islands?" asked Grace, reluctant to reach port
too early.</p>

<p>"We might," agreed Mae, "if we were sure
to be safe from sand bars."</p>

<p>"Water's splendidly deep," her sister at the
tiller assured her. "We may as well let the
girls see all the sights."</p>

<p>Accordingly, the Blowell was directed toward
the islands, that seemed like mere splashes of
green, spilled on the blue water.</p>

<p>In and out they went in apparent safety,
every one enjoying the close land sailing, and
the glimpses of varied woodlands these little
islands exhibited.</p>

<p>"Tide's going out fast," called Mae, as the
sail swung north.</p>

<p>Eugenia did not reply. She thought she felt
something scrape.</p>

<p>A grinding sound assured her, she <i>had</i> heard
scraping&mdash;and she knew the feel of sand.</p>

<p>They stopped like a canoe running out of the
waves!</p>

<p>"Sand bar!" shouted Mae, but none of the
girls knew just what that meant.</p>

<p>Opening the sail, clear of every reef, Mae
tried to get off the bar, and Eugenia urged the
tiller to try one spot, then another; but the
Blowell stood still, and defied the breeze or
water to move her.</p>

<p>"Can't we go?" asked Cleo, just beginning
to realize their predicament.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not unless we are lifted," replied Mae
gloomily.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to tell us we are stuck?"
asked Louise.</p>

<p>"That's the simplest way of putting it," replied
Eugenia.</p>

<p>"Then," said Grace, still imbued with the
spirit of fun. "Where do we go from here?"</p>

<p>"That's a delicate question," replied Helen,
for both Mae and Eugenia were too busy to pay
heed to nonsense.</p>

<p>For some time they tried all tactics known to
navigators caught in a similar predicament,
then finally settled down to make the best of a
bad bargain.</p>

<p>"Why can't we go in to shore on the little
boat?" asked Grace, still anxious to try the
dory.</p>

<p>"What good would that do us?" asked Mae.</p>

<p>"Some one may be camped there," Grace
added further.</p>

<p>"Even so, a camper couldn't move the Blowell
more than we can," said Eugenia.</p>

<p>"Our only hope is a tow," reflected Mae,
"and I don't see a launch, and no launch could
ever see us in this pocket."</p>

<p>"I'm so sorry I suggested the islands," said
Grace contritely. "Of course, I'm a very green
sailor."</p>

<p>"Not your fault in the least," Eugenia assured.
"We should have known better."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>"And when may the tide come in?" asked
Julia innocently.</p>

<p>"Some time <span class="smcap">A. M.</span>," said Mae, hiding her concern
with a brave show of indifference.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say we must stay out here
all night?" gasped Helen.</p>

<p>"I hate to say it, but it may be true," said
Mae slowly. "Still, a launch may loom up.
Any provisions left?"</p>

<p>At this the remains of their lunch were
dragged out from the cabin, and as they viewed
the most glorious sunset they had ever witnessed,
they munched crumbs, and tried to keep
up their spirits, which were plainly going down
with the ball of red gold.</p>

<p>It was a gloomy prospect. No way of sending
a message home, no one to give them a tow,
and as Cleo put it just "nobody nor nawthin'."</p>

<p>It was fast coming nightfall! Brave as they
were the scouts worried more about the home
folks than they did at their own predicament.</p>

<p>"If I could only let mama know!" sighed
Julia with a melancholy look at the only things
moving, and they were merely sunset clouds.</p>

<p>"Never give up," counselled Mae. "We are
in no danger, at least that is something."</p>

<p>"What's that song about the 'dove on the
mast'?" asked Cleo moodily. "Something about
he did mourn, and mourn and mourn."</p>

<p>"Don't you dare perpetrate that," said Mae.
"You are thinking of the famous old sob song,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
'Oh, Fair Dove, oh, Fond Dove'. But please
forget it. It does not fit in the picture."</p>

<p>"Just the same," insisted Grace, "I think
we ought to go in to that island. See how dark
it is getting, and there might be some help
there."</p>

<p>With an amount of coaxing Grace and Cleo,
with Eugenia and Helen, were finally allowed to
row into shore, and as the water was perceptibly
shallow, it was decided by Mae, as captain, that
the little trip could be made in perfect safety.</p>

<p>"I must stay with the Blowell," she said, "as
I might feel an under current strong enough to
move us. Don't delay too long."</p>

<p>They were glad to leave the sail boat, if only
temporarily. It had become monotonous, if not
actually gloomy to sit there, longing to move.</p>

<p>A short pull brought the dory on to land, and
briskly the girls sprang ashore. Along the edge
just a stretch of sand, untraveled, greeted
them.</p>

<p>"No footprints here," Grace remarked. "But
it's nice and smooth; a lovely little island."</p>

<p>"Yes, if we were merely looking for nature's
beauties," replied Eugenia. "But just now we
would rather run across a stuttering telephone."</p>

<p>"There is a wireless station somewhere
around here," said Cleo. "I remember reading
about it being outside of Sandy Hook."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose we are outside of anything?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
asked Helen. "I feel we are tied with
a drawstring in nature's hip pocket."</p>

<p>"Here's a footprint," called Cleo. "Just
look; here's a sign!"</p>

<p>All ran toward her and found tacked on a
tree a crudely marked cardboard. On this they
managed to decipher the words, "Peter Pan"
and "Take me to Mama."</p>

<p>"Perhaps some picnic children left that
here," decided Eugenia. "No other sign of
mortal habitation about."</p>

<p>"Yes, here is a child's shovel and pail, and a
lot of child's play tools," said Helen.</p>

<p>"Relics of the same outing party," commented
Louise. "Just see if you can't dig up
something more humanly tangible, Helen."</p>

<p>Dusk made the woods almost dark, and lest
they should stray too far inland Mae was to give
signals on her police whistle. Three short and
two long would mean "hurry back." Occasionally
they stopped to listen for the call.</p>

<p>"Some child has been digging here very recently,"
insisted Cleo. "This sand and clay
are damp yet."</p>

<p>"The picnic might have been to-day," Louise
replied.</p>

<p>"You're not very encouraging Weasie. Just
see how deep this hole is, and how it is being
dug&mdash;like&mdash;a tunnel."</p>

<p>Every one followed Cleo's plea for an investigation,
and at each turn they seemed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
come upon more toys and tools, such as little
boys play with.</p>

<p>"And here's another sign," called Helen.
"On yellow paper, too."</p>

<p>This brought the scouts to close attention.
The sign was evidently an attempt at a message,
and carried the same words "Peter Pan"
and "Bring me to Mamma," but with it was a
pathetically written word "Please," through
the letters of which were crudely drawn, by
surely a childish hand, the quaintest little flowers.</p>

<p>"Just see!" said Cleo. "No child on a picnic
would take time to draw flowers in a sign."
She turned over the card and found on the reverse
side the words that might mean "I&mdash;dig&mdash;out&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Eugenia who was familiar with kindergarten
work, readily recognized this as an attempt
made by some child who had been taught to
make floral words to indicate loving messages.
She was turning the paper over carefully when
the signal for "Hurry Back" was sounded
shrilly on the police whistle.</p>

<p>"Hurry, hurry, hurry!" called Eugenia, and
scampering through the woods, they jumped
into their little boat and started off, Cleo still
carrying the two Peter Pan messages.</p>

<p>Reaching the clearance they could see a
launch pulled up beside the Blowell.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, joy!" fairly screamed Helen. "A
launch!"</p>

<p>It did not take long to row back to the sand
bar, where Mae had already been towed off, out
into the welcome deep water.</p>

<p>"Oh, how splendid! Just in time!" they
shouted, and Eugenia had difficulty in requiring
that they sit still and not spill overboard.</p>

<p>Reaching the sailboat, never was found a
happier face than Mae's.</p>

<p>"Oh, girls, I told you not to give up," she
greeted them. "Just see our rescuer, Mr. Neal
Nelson from the Colonade."</p>

<p>"Oh, my little choker's brother!" exclaimed
Julia, too delighted to think of the usual formalities.</p>

<p>"And as I live, if it isn't&mdash;Bobby's life
saver!" declared the young man. "Well, turn
about is surely fair play, and I'm glad I got my
innings in."</p>

<p>"However did you find us?" asked Julia when
they were making sure the Blowell could "sail
under her own steam" as Neal put it.</p>

<p>"I didn't&mdash;I just happened by. Out trying
my new motor boat&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She's a beauty," commented Mae, feeling
foolish as she uttered the words, for any old
tug boat would have been a beauty under the
circumstances.</p>

<p>How differently everything looked now! It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
was almost worth while being in peril to experience
the joy of rescue.</p>

<p>"How did you like it over there?" called
Neal, who was now keeping close enough alongside
the Blowell to permit of conversation.</p>

<p>"Nice little island," answered Cleo. "I guess
picnickers like it there."</p>

<p>"I fancy not," replied the young man. "Folks
are not invited over there, I understand."</p>

<p>"Why?" questioned Eugenia, who was interested
in the kindergarten effort discovered on
the island.</p>

<p>"Nobody knows and nobody cares," he replied,
using the words of the latest popular
song.</p>

<p>"We're going back there some day," declared
Grace. "Found signs and things never
left there by the Indians."</p>

<p>"Indians live there yet, I should think," replied
Neal, turning on some more gas to keep
up with the pace the Blowell was making.</p>

<p>"What's the name of that island, do you
know?" called Grace.</p>

<p>"Surely," he replied, with a laugh in his boyish
voice. "That's the famous Luna Land!"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3>THE BAREFOOT GIRLS</h3>


<div class='cap'>"LOOK! Look!" shrieked Grace. "That's
Luna Land!"</div>

<p>"Oh, isn't that too stupid!" added
Cleo, almost in dismay. "To think we were
wandering around there and didn't know it."</p>

<p>"But how were we fooled?" asked Julia, also
showing signs of keen disappointment.</p>

<p>"Don't you see we went in on the other side,"
explained Helen. "That's the pocket and just
as I thought we were in the old hip pocket. Isn't
that too mean!"</p>

<p>Eugenia and Mae were now made aware of
the girls' eager expectations for a trip to that
island, and when every one had finally been convinced
that the trip had really been made without
the least suspicion of its consummation,
there seemed nothing to do but demand a good
laugh from the odd occurrence.</p>

<p>All stood up to watch the very last speck of
green, as Luna Land disappeared, and only the
added interest and anxiety, consequent upon
their delay, and the need to hasten back to the
waiting home folks, tended to break the spell.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>"To have actually been on that island!" repeated
Grace, trying to realize it.</p>

<p>"And to have gathered signs there," put in
Cleo. "Glad I took them along, although I did
so unconsciously."</p>

<p>"We must have a troop meeting to-morrow,"
said Margaret. "This alters everything."</p>

<p>"I think it simply turns on the gasoline," remarked
Grace. "Now, we know something
about Looney Land."</p>

<p>Neal was leading in his new launch, and the
Blowell followed as proudly as if nothing had
occurred to spoil her trip. It was almost dark,
but not quite, as the long summer evening stayed
and over-stayed, to the benefit of the belated
sailors.</p>

<p>"There's Leonore and Ben," sang out Grace,
as they caught sight of the blue car waiting at
the landing.</p>

<p>"Also Gerald and&mdash;yes, it's Isabel," called
Helen, for from her family car a girl in Isabel's
green sweater was waving merrily to the
incoming craft.</p>

<p>Explanations with details of delays on a sailboat
seemed entirely superfluous, and with creditable
good sense the stranded party was welcomed
home, without the worry of sighs or
sobs.</p>

<p>"But why did you go to the city to-day of
all days?" Cleo demanded of Isabel. "We<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
have had the event of the season, and you
should have been among those present."</p>

<p>"The dentist," explained Isabel, making
room for her chums in the car. "Nothing on
earth but a tyrannical dentist could drag me
away from Sea Crest in mid season."</p>

<p>"Well, I thought it must have been something
urgent," Cleo conceded. "But, Izzy love! We
have been to Luna Land!"</p>

<p>"You didn't tell us!" charged Elizabeth.
She had been to the city with Isabel.</p>

<p>"We didn't know," returned Cleo. "It was
an accident&mdash;a miraculous accident."</p>

<p>Followed such snatchy bits of explanation as
might be given on the short ride home. Isabel
and Elizabeth seemed quite as much absorbed in
the fact that their friend Neal had a new motor
boat as did they in the revelation concerning
Luna Land.</p>

<p>The evening attraction of moonlight bathing
served to divert, temporarily, the girls' keen
interest in holding a True Tred meeting immediately.
Every one wanted to go straight back
to the island&mdash;no dogs had devoured them, no
lunatics were discovered up trees, no ghosts
had been noticed ambling about the grove, and
why had they even hesitated to explore there?
Each demanded an answer from each, but none
replied.</p>

<p>Moonlight, like all the other released atmospheric
beauties, came "double barreled," and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
crowds flocked to the beach for the novelty of
evening bathing.</p>

<p>"And of course, we're too young," grumbled
Isabel. "I just wonder if the water is the same
day as night. Come on, let's wade."</p>

<p>This was the signal for wading preparations.
In a sheltered corner under the board walk, the
girls divested themselves of their shoes and
stockings, scampered back to the edge and encountered
knee deep waves or wavelets.</p>

<p>"Wading is really decorous in the dark,"
boomed Elizabeth. "It's lots more fun than
even bathing in daylight."</p>

<p>"But not as good as swimming," replied
Louise, who had just allowed her pretty pink
scarf-sash to come in contact with the ruinous
salt water.</p>

<p>At the sound of the nine-thirty gong&mdash;it was
the village fire alarm that always sounded the
hour&mdash;the scouts as well as the other merrymakers
hurried to dress. True, they had but
to don stockings and pumps, but the beach
crowds scattered so quickly, it was necessary to
hurry, or run the risk of being alone with the
crabs.</p>

<p>"Where did you put the things?" Cleo called
to Grace. "I don't see them here."</p>

<p>"Left them exactly against the third post
from the steps, coming toward the shoe black
stand," Grace indicated.</p>

<p>"That would be all right on an income tax<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
blank," sang out Cleo, after a fruitless search,
"but it does not betray the boots. They're not
here."</p>

<p>"Oh lands, hurry!" begged Elizabeth. "We
shall be all alone with Davy Jones or Mr. McGinty
or whoever it is who janities the ocean by
night. Let's all look."</p>

<p>No need for this proposal for all were looking;
they needed pumps and stockings, but none
could be found.</p>

<p>"Are you sure you left them here?" asked
Louise again.</p>

<p>"Positive," replied Grace.</p>

<p>"And I saw them when I went for my bag,"
said Elizabeth. "I remember now, I left the
pocket flash light burning&mdash;forgot to turn it
off."</p>

<p>"You left a light in the sand by our things!"
exclaimed Cleo. "Brilliant Betty! Well, why
wouldn't the small boys walk off with them,
either for fun or profit."</p>

<p>"I see nothing to do but play hop scotch
home," said Helen dolefully. "And they were
my best patent leathers."</p>

<p>"My silk stockings broke the family bank,"
chimed in Louise. "Mother had just declared
they would be the very last pair."</p>

<p>"Let's go to the pier and beg matches," suggested
Isabel. "I don't fancy skipping all the
way to Third Avenue 'as is,' whatever way that
may be, but I believe it applies to any sort of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
goods not up to the best mark, and with bare
feet I don't feel quite par excellence."</p>

<p>"Still you do the Greek dances beautifully,"
consoled Louise. "Let us take this philosophically.
We have lost our booties and we must
go home. Now let's&mdash;&mdash;" and she raced off
with all the barefoot scouts after her.</p>

<p>Not that they minded that in the least, but the
loss of silk stockings and pumps was not a
good joke, even to the jolly True Treds.</p>

<p>Danger of broken glass and alighting on
sharp pebbles varied the hopping, skipping and
jumping, until the last scout dusted her toes and
tried to explain the bare-foot stunt to surprised
relatives.</p>

<p>Early next morning, that portion of the beach
where the clothing had been lost was visited,
first by one, and then another, until without
arranging to do so, the whole party had again
assembled.</p>

<p>"What shall we do about it?" asked Grace.
"No use allowing any one to get away with five
pairs of pumps and stockings."</p>

<p>"Besides a flash light and my bag," inserted
Elizabeth.</p>

<p>"I guess we will have to put a sign on the
post office," suggested Cleo.</p>

<p>This was met with a howl of ridicule.</p>

<p>"Can you imagine everybody devouring a
neat little sign that stated five pairs of stockings&mdash;&mdash;?"
Grace asked.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, don't," begged Helen. "Let's do
without them and wear sneaks. If we all set
in to wearing them folks will think they are the
very latest thing in footgear," she said pompously.</p>

<p>"Look what I dug up," Cleo exclaimed, displaying
a rather disfigured pair of tennis shoes.
"Jerry decorated them last summer, when he
was trying out some new water colors. See
that emblem there?" pointing to something like
a wish-bone design. "Well, that's his frat emblem,"
she told her companions.</p>

<p>"Then it's decided we let the shoes go, and
all our poor luck with them," said Isabel. "But
I do feel rather mournful about my pretty
buckles."</p>

<p>"Let's hie to the bungalow, and talk over our
delayed plans to further invade Luna Land,"
called out Louise, poised on a treacherous sand
heap. "I'm just dying for another try at that
mystery."</p>

<p>In the conclave it was decided to ask Neal
for a ride in his lovely new motor boat.</p>

<p>"That will be the safest way to go," said
Louise, "as it would afford the quickest chance
of getting away."</p>

<p>"Nothing to be afraid of," Cleo said disdainfully.</p>

<p>"How do we know?" argued Isabel. "Just
because no bears jumped out at us is not proof
there were none up the trees."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>"Bears don't climb the trees," retorted
Elizabeth.</p>

<p>"Well, <i>we</i> might have to and it's just the
same," insisted Isabel.</p>

<p>"Do you know," said Cleo. "I wouldn't be
surprised if some little child over there is playing
Peter Pan!"</p>

<p>"That's nothing. Every child plays Peter
Pan," cut in Margaret. "Didn't you tell us
Mary Dunbar went up a tree at Bellaire?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but I mean a child who is living out
the character, if that explains it more clearly,"
said Cleo.</p>

<p>"Nothing startling about that either," commented
Helen, who admitted she was fairly
"sizzling" for a mystery.</p>

<p>"Maybe Bentley wrote those signs," said
Julia.</p>

<p>"Bentley!" exclaimed Grace. "That big
boy wrote 'Take me to mama'! Julia, Julia,
Julia! Are you as far gone as that?"</p>

<p>"He could write them for fun, couldn't he?"
fired back the much tantalized girl.</p>

<p>"Well, he could, of course, but how would he
get the fun out of doing a thing like that? No,
we have to look either for a freak or a poor
neglected child. Now, True Treds, take your
choice!" advised Louise.</p>

<p>"I choose the freak," decided Cleo. "Freaks
are funny."</p>

<p>"And I take the chee-i-ld!" trilled Grace,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
"children need to be cared for, and True Treds
should help."</p>

<p>"Whatever will Captain Dave think when he
hears we have been on the forbidden ground?"
asked Louise. "I care more for his opinion
than for anything else."</p>

<p>"Guess we all do," said Margaret seriously.
"We wouldn't like him to think we actually defied
him."</p>

<p>"But wasn't it the most delicious joke,"
Grace reminded them. "When I didn't die a
sudden death as Neal called out 'Why, that's
Luna Land!' I will tell you girls, I am doomed
to a ripe old age."</p>

<p>"Suppose we go right down now, and tell
Captain Dave all about it?" proposed Louise.
"I shall feel better when the dark secret is off
my conscience."</p>

<p>"A wise plan," declared Margaret, "but I
don't like these slippers for a walk at this hour,
too near bathing time. Anybody going in to-day?"</p>

<p>"Surely, but there's plenty of time yet,"
argued Grace. "All in favor of a trip to Captain
Dave's&mdash;run."</p>

<p>Along the grassy edge of Glimmer Lake it
was only a short run to the life saving station
and, just as they hoped, the genial captain sat
outside, in his big, strong chair, smoking the
faithful pipe.</p>

<p>"You can never guess where we have been,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
Captain?" Cleo began quickly, as the girls
were able to flock about.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes I can," he replied to their surprise.
"You been over to the island."</p>

<p>They were astonished. Who had told him in
so short a time?</p>

<p>"How did you know?" asked Grace.</p>

<p>"Little bird," mumbled the captain. He
did seem a trifle serious for him.</p>

<p>"Not the carrier pigeon?" asked Louise.
"And you don't mind, do you Captain Dave?"</p>

<p>"We had no idea of going," Helen hurried
to say, before the seaman could answer.</p>

<p>"So you got stranded?" he asked, as usual
bringing his helpless pipe into play.</p>

<p>Then followed an account of the accident that
ended in the precipitous visit to Luna Land.</p>

<p>"But who told you about it, Captain?" asked
Grace once more.</p>

<p>"Kitty," he replied simply.</p>

<p>"Kitty saw us!" Margaret gasped. The
surprise intended for Captain Dave had been
diverted, it appeared.</p>

<p>"Yes, Kitty was there; but she saw what
happened, as she explained it to me, and she
knew you wouldn't stay long," explained the
old sailor.</p>

<p>"But why didn't she speak to us?" pouted
Cleo.</p>

<p>"Guess she thought it was safer to let you
get off quietly as you got on," replied the Captain,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
and his deep set eyes wandered out over
that familiar sea, although his audience wondered
what ever he could see there to hold
his attention after so many years of watching.</p>

<p>"I think she might have trusted us," said
Helen, showing something like resentment.</p>

<p>"It likely was not that," the captain assured
the girls. "She'd trust you, I'm sure, but she
might not trust others," he finished mysteriously.</p>

<p>They seemed further than ever now from
their purpose. The captain was rather reticent,
though usually so genial, in fact, for the
first time the scouts felt as if their visit might
not be entirely welcome.</p>

<p>Could he be displeased with them? The language
of their glances asked that question
plainly.</p>

<p>"But we did have the awfulest time," Louise
broke the awkward silence. "Captain, it's
lovely to sail, and our Blowell was like a sea
queen, until we struck that sand bar, then she
stuck like&mdash;like the Brooklyn Bridge, not a
thing could move her. We did break a couple
of oars trying to pry ourselves loose, but a sand
bar is a mighty power when you hit it wrong
side up," finished Louise, proud of her attempt
to interest the rather silent captain.</p>

<p>"Anything wrong, Captain?" Grace asked,
with her usual directness. "You look worried."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>"Maybe I am a bit," he admitted. "But
nothing very serious," and he made his pipe
serve to emphasize the fact.</p>

<p>"Could we help you?" inquired Helen simply.</p>

<p>The old sea man smiled and reached over to
pat her shoulders. She was sitting on the
steps, and he sat just above in the hickory arm
chair.</p>

<p>"I've been tryin' to figure out who might
help me," he replied finally, "and I've about
concluded you little girls would be as safe as
anybody. And queer thing, too&mdash;" he went on.
"You're the first&mdash;who ever offered to help old
Dave, though many a one <i>he</i> has pulled out of
that briny."</p>

<p>The girls moved closer to the hickory chair.
Not one felt she could break that spell by speaking.</p>

<p>"But it will be quite a story," continued the
captain, "and it is nigh on to eight bells
now. Suppose you come around here this
afternoon after your swim&mdash;no, best after dinner,"
he corrected himself. "The men have
to eat on the stroke of twelve, then we have
drill, and some government messages to explain&mdash;make
it two-thirty," he said finally, "and
we'll see what we can do."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3>A RELIC FROM THE ALAMEDA</h3>


<div class='cap'>EAGER for the captain's story every scout
was on hand promptly at two-thirty.
The captain dusted off the wooden settee,
and pulled out all his chairs, for the True Treds
were meeting as if in council.</div>

<p>"It's about Kitty," he began. "Of course,
you have guessed that. But what set me on
this course was the way you have made friends
with that heedless one. Seems to me you would
stick by her in a pinch."</p>

<p>"We surely would, Captain," spoke up
Grace, and her voice had in it the ring of the
familiar "Aye, aye, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, you see," went on the captain, "she's
so queer, no one makes friends with her. But
from the furst I was a'watchin' you 'uns, as
they say at Old Point, and I was curious to see
if she was going to scare you off, as she had
done to all the others."</p>

<p>"I guess she tried," Louise could not refrain
from interrupting, for the memory of Kitty's
throw of the paste board box was still vivid.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, she tried, and she has told me how she
plagued you, but accordin' to Kitty you wouldn't
quit."</p>

<p>"Not exactly quitters," ventured Cleo.</p>

<p>From his smile of approval it was plain the
captain agreed with every interruption, and
they seemed to whet his interest in the story
he had undertaken to tell. He continued:</p>

<p>"Just noticin' and watchin' I says to myself,
there is the very thing Kitty has always
needed; girls, real live, jolly girls; and she
ain't never had none."</p>

<p>He expressed himself more pathetically when
he fell into the vernacular. "No sir, she ain't
never had none," he repeated. "Then along
you come, just for the summer, and she tried
every blusterin' trick she could make use of to
scare you off, to sort of bamboozle you, but you
stick, and so, she's sort of givin' in. Especially
since you befriended old Pete. That won her
sure."</p>

<p>"She told us that she appreciated that," said
Cleo. "But it was only fun to drive him to the
landing. Of course, he wouldn't hear of us
driving around to the Point, from where he
could more easily have gone across to the
island."</p>

<p>"Now then, thinking all those things over,
and puttin' two and two together, as you might
say, I've sort of concluded to ask you to do
something more. And I almost feel I know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
your answer," pursued the well-trained narrator.</p>

<p>"You surely must know it, Captain," Cleo
assured him. "I am acting captain of this
troop&mdash;the True Tred. I am really only troop
leader for the summer, but the girls call me
captain, and I can speak for every one here, I
know, when I say, we will do our utmost to
help you, or to fulfill any trust you may offer."</p>

<p>At this the True Treds arose, and quite seriously
gave their salute. So impressed was old
Captain Dave, that he also tilted himself out of
his tip chair, and likewise saluted. No one
smiled&mdash;they were now engaged in serious work
as True Treds.</p>

<p>"That's fine," he said heartily. "I tell you
my boys can't beat that at drillin'. I just wish
I could get a girl's team working some day,"
he complimented. "Wouldn't wonder if you
could do as well as some boys.</p>

<p>"But back to Kitty," and his pipe was thoroughly
emptied on the little tin plate at his
elbow. "You see, the night her poor little
mother was swung in from the Alameda with
that youngster in her arms, we were too busy
to do much but try to keep the freezin' folks
alive. She had talked some to the little girl,
and she had asked me to look out for the luggage.</p>

<p>"Well, when Mrs. Schulkill dies on the way
to the hospital, and her name appears in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
list of those lost, along comes Kitty's relatives,
the folks they were comin' to live with. I
turned over the luggage and all that sort of
stuff we could get off the Alameda before she
foundered, but I just made up my mind I'd
keep an eye on Kitty. Also, I'd hold on to
her papers a bit, 'til these folks really proved
they were good friends to the orphan." He
shook his head in decision at the memory.</p>

<p>"I've done that," he declared, "and I have
the papers. Now, they worry me some. How
do I know what'll happen to me? I'm gettin'
old, and the seas are pretty rough at times."</p>

<p>He paused, and the girls noticed how gray his
face looked, and how haggard and heavily lined.</p>

<p>"This packet of papers was in a tin box," he
then explained. "Kitty's mother was comin'
home from Holland, and being a widow, she
kept all her little belongings with her. I have
them in the same little box, and as I have
glanced over them I just feel they'll be mighty
interestin' when the girl gets sense enough to
understand them.</p>

<p>"Now, I've thought of turnin' them over to a
lawyer here, but what would that mean? A
fee; of course, I have no fee, neither has Kitty.
Then, if I trust some one around here, they'll
likely go pokin' into them, curious like; and I
don't want to do a thing like that to the mother
who left her little girl in my arms."</p>

<p>He stroked his beard thoughtfully. The papers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
were plainly a considerable responsibility
to carry. He looked out over the sea again,
and shook his head thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Are they letters or documents?" asked
Cleo.</p>

<p>"Little of both," replied the captain. "And
this is my plan. You girls must know some organization
that would just take this little responsibility
off Dave's shoulders."</p>

<p>"Certainly," spoke up Louise. "The Girl
Scouts have a very trustworthy headquarters,
and if this particular piece of work was not
ours we could very readily place it where it
belongs."</p>

<p>"Exactly, just exactly. That's what I've
been a-thinkin'," said the Captain.</p>

<p>"There are Children's Aids, Travellers' Aids
and all sorts of legal aids for just such purposes,"
said Margaret, "and if we bring anything
confidential to the secretary at our headquarters,
you may rest assured it will be placed
where it belongs."</p>

<p>"Now, isn't that fine!" exclaimed the old sailor.
"But you are not goin' up to the city soon,
I take it, and I've just got a notion I'd like
them papers put in safer quarters. No tellin'
when I may be transferred, and then I wouldn't
have time to think of the little tin box. Could
one of you take it now, and put it in your family
safe?" he asked.</p>

<p>The girls looked at one another speculatively.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
No one was personally anxious to assume such a
responsibility.</p>

<p>"Louise, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'you're'">your</ins> daddy is a lawyer. He
would know all about a thing like that. You
take it?" urged Margaret.</p>

<p>After some discussion Louise finally agreed
to accept the charge and old Dave shuffled over
to his cupboard, procured a rusty tin box, and
placed it in the scout's hand.</p>

<p>"There," he said with a sigh of relief. "I'm
glad to get rid of that. It was like the little
bundle of letters tied with blue ribbon, that we
read about in love stories&mdash;not much to the
world, but a lot to the right girl," he orated.</p>

<p>Louise looked at the box almost reverently.
Just as Dave had said "not much to the world
but a lot to the right girl," she thought.</p>

<p>"All right, Captain," she said bravely. "I
am sure, simple as this is it does mean something,
and as you say, Kitty is not yet wise
enough to appreciate her mother's letters. So
I accept the charge, and you may call upon
me to report at any time you choose."</p>

<p>"Now, if I'm sent over to the Hook, I won't
have to move quite so much," said Dave with
something like a chuckle, for the box was a very
small article to worry about in event of an
ordinary moving. "Also," he continued, "I'll
feel Kitty is in good hands with this sort of&mdash;well,
sort of claim on your friendship," he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
stammered. "You see, how wise I am, to link
you together this way?"</p>

<p>It had been rather a serious half hour, and
the True Treds were not prone to stay concentrated
for any prolonged length of time. As it
was, Isabel had been counting the blocks in
the faded red table cover, and Helen was drawing
pictures with a burnt match on the back of
a marine magazine.</p>

<p>"Now, I've got some good news, after all the
old mildewed stuff," said Captain Dave. "You
have been wanting to see our men at drill.
What would you say to coming down some
morning soon&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;Wonder would
I be spilling the beans if I told you a secret?" he
broke off.</p>

<p>"Trust us to pick them up carefully if you
do, Captain," volunteered Cleo.</p>

<p>"Well, here's the news," and he sank lower
in his chair, dropped his head deeper on his
shoulders, and seemed to assume the most secretive
and confidential air. "Listen," he
commanded. "The Boy Scouts are to have a
wig wag trial. They may have been a little
mite jealous of your reputation, or something
like that, anyhow, they've fixed it up to do a
grand stand stunt, and they've enlisted the
Beach Patrol&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But we have been begging for that all summer,"
interrupted Grace immediately on the
offensive.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>"I recall that, and it's why I am spilling the
beans. Why can't you all join in?"</p>

<p>"With the Boy Scouts?" It was Louise
who spoke.</p>

<p>"Certainly," Margaret hurried to say.
"Why not? They will enter us if we send an
application. Oh, goody-good! Louise run right
home with the tin box, lock it in the safe and
come have a troop meeting," sang out Margaret.</p>

<p>"Don't have to say where you heard the
news, do you?" asked the captain with a
chuckle.</p>

<p>"Certainly not," declared Cleo. "Besides,
we know exactly where we can verify it. Come
on, girls. Let's interview the clerk at the landing
soda fountain. You remember he told us
he was a scout."</p>

<p>They all remembered, and ran thither forewith,
as Grace would say.</p>

<p>"To think of the boys planning to outdo us in
glory," Cleo reflected. "Well, we had better
be busy, True Treds, and get ready to prove
our mettle."</p>

<p>It was exciting even to anticipate, and that
the Boy Scouts were going to considerable trouble
in their preparations now dawned forcibly
upon the girls.</p>

<p>"That's what all the wig wag practising has
been for," Margaret declared. "I have seen
the boys on the beach every morning so early.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
I'm sure they know the code backwards and
forwards."</p>

<p>"Exactly," agreed Louise. "How many
brought manuals?"</p>

<p>"I did," replied Julia, but it was a solo.</p>

<p>"Then, we will all have to look over your
shoulder, Julia dear," said Cleo. "It would
be dreadful if we missed a letter."</p>

<p>"How are we going to get in the contest
though? That's what worries me," declared
Helen.</p>

<p>"First, find out all about it," advised Cleo
practically. "Then, follow the advice of our
friend what's-his-name at the landing. Louise,
be careful of Kitty's papers," she ordered.
"Isn't it lovely to have won the confidence of
Captain Dave?"</p>

<p>"Lovelier still to live up to it," replied
Louise, in her best oratorical tone, "I would
have preferred some one else to take the tin
box, but since I have it, I suppose I'll have to
sit up nights watching it," she deplored.</p>

<p>"Lucky it's only letters, and not deeds to
some monarchy," put in Helen. "But count on
all of us, Weasie dear, to stand by you in case
of any safe-blowing at midnight."</p>

<p>"I'm so excited about the contest, I can almost
forget Kitty and Luna Land," gurgled
Margaret. They were running along the lakeside,
up to the river landing, with the hope of
gaining the boy's confidence over nut sundaes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>"He's there! That's lucky!" Helen said,
sighting in the open pavilion, the desired Boy
Scout, just in the act of sizzling a soda.</p>

<p>"And he has on a clean apron, a good sign,"
said Margaret under her breath.</p>

<p>Tables nearest the water and farthest from
land (thus most secluded) were chosen, and
favorite frappes were smilingly ordered.</p>

<p>"Listen to catch his name," whispered Cleo,
but a call for "Tommie" voided the suggestion.
Tommie fetched their sundaes in that miraculous
way waiters have of carrying cup and
saucers heaped up, just as jugglers catch them.</p>

<p>"Been practicin'?" inquired Grace glibly.</p>

<p>"What for?" asked Tommie, whisking his
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'towl'">towel</ins> over the table.</p>

<p>"Why, for the contest," answered Grace, as
if the whole world should know that.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes a little," admitted Tommie, gliding
off to a new customer.</p>

<p>"Didn't notice that he waved any program,"
said Louise.</p>

<p>"Don't give up," Margaret encouraged. "I
could manage another sundae."</p>

<p>"So could I if I had the price," said Helen
dryly.</p>

<p>Cleo tapped on the table and Tommie sauntered
back.</p>

<p>"Say Tommie, you know we are strangers
here," she began adroitly, "and don't know a
single Girl Scout in town, and we are supposed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
to keep up our activities. How do we get in
the contest?"</p>

<p>"Who told you about it?" he asked, his face
betraying the fatal boyish weakness of succumbing
to girls' flattering attention.</p>

<p>"Why, folks are talking about it, of course,"
went on Cleo sweetly. "It promises to be a
big event."</p>

<p>"Bet your life," and the secret spring had
been tapped. "That will be some event. We
wanted to flash a surprise, but you being Girl
Scouts, I think you ought to be in it."</p>

<p>"Of course, we should," came a chorus.</p>

<p>"Tell you what I'll do. I'll propose it at
to-night's meeting. I saw you girls save the
Bentley chap, and I know you're game," he
said stoutly, "so I don't see why not."</p>

<p>"Good for you, Tommie!" Helen wanted
to cheer. "And when they put you up for
office, just let the True Treds know."</p>

<p>"That's right, Tommie," Cleo assured the
blushing boy. "We'll see you through."</p>

<p>And why shouldn't they? As Tommie said:
"I don't see why not."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<h3>THE WIG WAG RESCUE</h3>


<div class='cap'>"THEY'LL be sure to enjoy the shouting,"
Julia remarked, "but aside from that,
I don't see what interest spectators
can possibly work up in a wig wag contest."</div>

<p>"We almost agree with you, Julie," said
Grace, "but don't you know everything, including
bad weather, is interesting at the beach?"</p>

<p>"All right, scouty, I'm glad of it, for I think
it is going to be simply great. And wasn't
it splendid to get the sanction of headquarters?"</p>

<p>"Trust Cleo to take care of the official end,"
replied Grace. "Don't forget to-day is the
day, and the pier is the place."</p>

<p>Signs of activity about the life saving station
always gathered a crowd, and to-day the appearance
of the men in uniform, pulling out the
life lines, hoisting the buoys and running the
life boat down to the water, drew more than
the usual number of spectators.</p>

<p>It was Scout Day and everybody seemed to
know it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>The boys having agreed to accept the challenge
of the girls, in true scout chivalry, now
offered the girls every possible courtesy, even
to choice of place at which to stand for the wig
wag try out.</p>

<p>It was arranged that Captain Dave's men
were to row outside the fish nets, and wait there
for their code to be waved to them for a "wreck
off the hook." The exactness and quickness
with which the message was waved was to be
judged by a committee of citizens with the
mayor as the honorary leader.</p>

<p>It had all been carefully planned as a summer
attraction, and the scouts were to share
in honors for their respective troops.</p>

<p>The blare of the firemen's band, affording
more blare than music, proclaimed the time had
come for a start, and the crack of Mayor Jones'
revolver gave the signal for a race through the
sand to gain places.</p>

<p>Cleo, Grace, Margaret and Louise won the
post for True Treds, they having outdistanced
the boys who were led by Tommie Johnson, and
who was said to stumble purposely so that the
girls might reach the pier first. However that
might be, the True Treds liked Tommie, and he
seemed to like them "pretty well," as Grace
expressed it.</p>

<p>No chance for holding conversation as a contest
preliminary, for the four scouts were
scattered at regular distances over the five<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
hundred foot pier, while the boys on the sand,
were dotted at similar distances, each armed
with the red and white signal flag.</p>

<p>An exhibition of signalling was first presented,
and this evoked generous applause from
the crowds that jammed the board walk. Naturally
the girls from their platform on the pier,
"looked the prettiest," but the way they flashed
their code did not admit of any self consciousness
on the score of looks.</p>

<p>In a brief interval Grace waved to Louise a
message in the True Tred secret code, and this
was taken up by Cleo and Margaret who relayed
it to Helen and Julia in their positions on
the beach.</p>

<p>"Grace says 'nervous,'" whispered Helen,
"and she is never nervous. I wonder what
she means?"</p>

<p>"Just joking, I guess. No, see they are
sending 'a,' that's error, of course," replied
Julia, holding her own flag up in the interrogatory
slant.</p>

<p>But the signal for the second event precluded
any possibility of following out the private messages
and presently all were again wrapped in
attention at the silent waving contest&mdash;that
language of distance, copied from the trees, and
fashioned from the winds.</p>

<p>"Look! Look!" gasped Julia. "Louise is
waving danger! What can be the matter."</p>

<p>Frantically the little scout on the extreme end<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
of the pier was spelling "danger," then shooting
her flag out to demand "attention."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's some one on the water," whispered
Helen, fearful of causing a panic in that crowd.</p>

<p>"And she is signalling the life boat," gasped
Julia. "But how far is it away?"</p>

<p>Suddenly Louise was seen to throw her flag
high in the air, and dive from the pier!</p>

<p>Shouts, screams, and yells rent the air!</p>

<p>"The boat, the guard, the life line!" the air
itself seemed to form the words, but only that
speck at the end of the pier could be seen now,
bobbing up and down, then&mdash;yes&mdash;it was a little
boat, a canoe! That was what the scout had
dived for!</p>

<p>If ever they had occasion to summon and
use courage, the scouts, both boys and girls,
had need of it now. Along the boardwalk the
excitement was so intense as to cause danger of
children being trampled on, and in this emergency
those Girl Scouts not on the pier helped
the Boy Scouts in efforts to prevent disaster.</p>

<p>But it was that tiny spot on the water that
held the crowd with a bated breath.</p>

<p>"She must drown! Oh, that lovely girl!"
they were gasping.</p>

<p>"Louise won't drown," said Julia, her face
white as the muslin in her flag.</p>

<p>"No, Weasie <i>can</i> swim," Helen assured her,
holding her arm very tight, and begging comfort
in the embrace.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>"And we can't even get near her," moaned
Julia, who just then had rescued a very little
tot from a plunge down the high steps into the
street.</p>

<p>"The line, the boat, they have her!" came
another shout, and Julia wanted to sink on her
knees.</p>

<p>"Oh, is the boat there? Can you see,
Helen?" she begged.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, it's the life boat, they have come!
Didn't it seem an eternity?"</p>

<p>Instantly the accident occurred police officers
had roped off the end of the pier to prevent any
one rushing in, and now there stood at the steps
the formidable ambulance.</p>

<p>"Oh, they must not take her to a hospital,"
wailed Helen. "Let us get to her, Julia. She
will surely be all right in a little while."</p>

<p>"They are bringing them in a life boat," a
gentlemen with marine glasses said. He had
seen their distress and recognized their uniform.</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you, but how can we get to
them?" begged Julia. "If only we could move
through this awful crowd."</p>

<p>"I have a police whistle," he said. "I'll just
blow it, and when the officer answers I'll explain.
Remain quietly where you are."</p>

<p>The magic whistle shrilled its signal, and the
crowd fell back, while the motorcycle officer answered.
The gentleman quickly explained the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
situation, and the two girls climbed to the rear
seat of the motor, where they clung, as the
officer piloted them through the autos and street
crowds up to the pier.</p>

<p>"They're in! They're in!" the people were
now shouting. But Julia and Helen were almost
afraid to look.</p>

<p>Leaving his motorcycle at the boardwalk, the
officer led the girls down on the sands where
the life boat had just made shore.</p>

<p>"Who&mdash;is&mdash;it, with her?" breathed Julia, for
they could now see that Louise sat up in the
boat and had some one in her arms.</p>

<p>"It's Kitty!" shouted Helen. "She jumped
to save Kitty. Oh, Louise, you darling! You
brave little True Tred!" she cried. "Let me
get to her."</p>

<p>In another moment Julia and Helen were
with Cleo and Margaret, who had easily climbed
down the pier, and were there when the boat
came in. Scarcely speaking, the little group
waited for a space to reach the life boat.</p>

<p>Louise, dripping, and sobbing just a little, sat
in the skiff&mdash;with the seemingly lifeless form
of Kitty in her arms. Quickly as landing was
made one of the life savers picked up the unconscious
girl, and rushed off with her, while another
attempted to lift Louise.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm all right," she protested. "I don't
need any help at all."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>But Captain Dave was there and he took no
such chance.</p>

<p>"Here, my girl," he commanded in a voice
of the seas. "Lean on me and come up to the
station. Come along," this to the other scouts,
"and you young ones keep back there," to the
boys.</p>

<p>Louise took a few steps, then faltered. As if
expecting this the captain stooped and lifted
her in his arms, and it was a sight to remember,
to see that old sailor, trudge along through the
sands with the little girl scout almost on his
broad shoulders.</p>

<p>And the remainder of the True Tred Troop
were pressing along at his heels.</p>

<p>"Keep back there, keep away," warned the
kind officer to the surging crowd, for the unspoken
admiration for the Girl Scouts was now
mounting high.</p>

<p>Tommie Johnson was so proud of "his
friends" that something like mutiny seemed
imminent in the boys' ranks.</p>

<p>"I told you, I told you!" he kept repeating,
quite as if he had foretold the entire occurrence,
when he only really referred to the courage of
the Girl Scouts.</p>

<p>Up in the life saving station guards vied with
one another in making hot tea, and giving such
administrations as might benefit Louise, while
she waited a few moments before being permitted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
to get in any one of the many cars, offered
to take her home.</p>

<p>"But I am really only wet now," she insisted
finally, "and I want to get out of this heavy
uniform."</p>

<p>Realizing her mother might have heard any
of the possible wild rumors, Captain Dave
helped her into Cleo's car and very proud indeed,
was the old sailor, of the wig wag rescue.</p>

<p>"No surprise to me," he told his men.
"Those girls have the grit many a boy might
well boast of, and when I saw her drop from
that pier I did not have to hold my breath. I
knew she'd make it."</p>

<p>"But how did she see that speck of a canoe
creep around the pier?" asked Jim Barstow,
the oldest member of the crew next to Captain
Dave.</p>

<p>"Maybe she felt it," said the captain.
"'Taint likely much would happen to Kitty
without that little girl feeling it." But his
men knew nothing of the trust he was recalling,
that might have formed the link of confidence
between the scouts and Kitty Scuttle.</p>

<p>Elizabeth, wise little friend, had rushed from
the pavilion to the home of Louise, to make
sure no report of drowning should reach the
ears of the anxious mother.</p>

<p>"It was the most glorious sight," Elizabeth
was just insisting when Gerald drew up with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
the blue car, and Louise jumped out into her
mother's arms.</p>

<p>"Up to the hospital, Jerry," ordered Cleo.
"We must see how Kitty is."</p>

<p>Julia and Helen went with Cleo, and it was
their uniform, as usual, that served as a pass,
admitting them to the hospital.</p>

<p>Kitty had been revived, and was now becoming
obstreperous, she insisted on going home,
and was loudly declaring her Uncle Pete would
die of fright, when he missed her and the canoe.</p>

<p>At the entrance of Cleo and Julia (Helen did
not come in) Kitty all but bounced out of the
little white bed, and then, when she could get
her thin arms around Cleo's neck&mdash;then the
tears fell.</p>

<p>"That will be good for her," said the nurse
very quietly to Julia. "She has been so
wrought up, the outburst will relieve the
strain."</p>

<p>But how Kitty could cry! And how she did
yell! Cleo patted her shoulders and soothed
her with every sort of affectionate protestation,
but all the girl seemed to want to do was cry,
and cry she did for so long a time, the scouts
felt more helpless with her than they had in
the real critical stage of the emergency.</p>

<p>"You be good, Kitty," said Cleo finally.
"And I'll go right up to the landing and shout
for Uncle Pete. Then, when he comes over, I'll
tell him all about it&mdash;that is how you are perfectly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
all right," she corrected herself. "If you
are very quiet, and good, maybe the nurse will
let me in again to tell you what he says."</p>

<p>"And do you think I'm going to stay in this
horspittal all night?" protested Kitty. "Don't
I know what they did to my mother."</p>

<p>This started another outburst, and seeing the
hysterical child was not apt to soon be quieted,
the nurse insisted on her swallowing a dose of
bromide, and at that juncture the girls quietly
stole from the bedside.</p>

<p>Gerald "dropped" Julia at her cottage, then
Cleo and Helen were driven to the landing. No
need to shout over to the island, for Uncle Pete
stood there, on the narrow dock, watching the
road with anxious eyes.</p>

<p>It was hard to assure him of Kitty's safety,
and only his personal knowledge of the power of
the scouts, gleaned from his own experience
when they had rescued him some weeks before,
did finally allay his fears. "We'll fetch her
back, first thing in the morning," they promised,
and then they watched the old man pull
his oars with a weary stroke, toward the lonely
little island, called Luna Land.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<h3>THE GLORIOUS AFTERMATH</h3>


<div class='cap'>THE wig wag contest had furnished enough
excitement at Sea Crest to constitute a
nine day's wonder. Nothing short of
an uncanny power seemed attributed to the
Girl Scout, who would risk her own life in a
dive from that pier, when she saw a canoe upset
beneath. The whole occurrence had been
so spectacular that the publicity it provoked
was widespread&mdash;every one was talking of the
wig wag rescue.</div>

<p>"But, Weasie dear," cooed Grace, "what
did it feel like to jump? Just tell us that and
then we'll let you off."</p>

<p>Louise smiled wanly. Was it possible that
any other question could be invented?</p>

<p>"It didn't exactly feel," she replied to Grace,
"but I knew I had to do it. I had been watching
the little speck of a boat as it took the
rollers from the side, and I knew the next would
toss it over. Then I saw Kitty&mdash;and I didn't
think of the distance after that."</p>

<p>"You looked about as big as a fish hawk diving
for his dinner," remarked Cleo, "and you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
nipped Kitty just as neatly as a hawk pecks his
fish."</p>

<p>"I felt just like that&mdash;it is birdlike to dive
from such a distance," Louise said, "and cutting
through the air, free of everything&mdash;is&mdash;is
wonderful."</p>

<p>"Even with the ocean as a backstop?" asked
Helen shivering.</p>

<p>"Nice and soft," Louise said reflectively.</p>

<p>"But however did you hold on to Kitty, and
cling to the canoe?" persisted Grace, in spite
of the promise to cease questioning.</p>

<p>"I don't know. It was black for awhile, and
I just struggled to keep up, and to keep Kitty
up. She was too scared to help herself, and
she had swallowed a lot of water. I guess I
managed to cling to the canoe&mdash;Girls, you don't
know what you can do until you have to," she
finished.</p>

<p>It was still early, but the visit to Kitty at the
hospital had to be made early, according to
promise. Louise and Margaret were to go, and
the other scouts, especially Julia and Grace,
were going in the car as far as the village, to be
picked up there by the girl's car on the way
back.</p>

<p>They found the patient dressed, and being
forcibly detained, as the nurse put it. In fact,
Kitty had been dressed since day break, and
nothing short of force did detain her.</p>

<p>"Good thing you come now," she greeted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
Margaret. "Oh, there's my life-saver. Hello,
McGinty, how's the water to-day? I don't
want to test it though," she shook her cropped
head, and the girls noticed how much better
that hair looked since its salt water shampoo.</p>

<p>"Don't hurry so, Kitty. You have plenty of
time. Uncle Pete said he would be over at the
landing at ten o'clock, and it's only nine now."
Louise told her.</p>

<p>"No matter what time," she retorted, "it's
next year to me. This place is haunted sure.
I was fishin' with ghosts all night."</p>

<p>"That was your bromide," Margaret assured
her. "You were so excited and hysterical
you simply had to be quieted down. Do
you feel all right?"</p>

<p>"Don't know as I feel at all," Kitty answered,
jerking herself up to make sure she
had not grown fins. "I never want to read
that Jonah story again. But I knew it! I
knew it!" and she chewed her lips in repressed
bitterness.</p>

<p>"Knew what?" Louise asked.</p>

<p>"That the old monster ocean would try to
swallow me," she replied. "Didn't I tell you
I would never go on that water after what it
done to me? But I did want to see that wig
waggin' and I went out because&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped, and the sharp little black eyes
were glistening.</p>

<p>"I know, Kitty. You wanted to see us beat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
the boys, didn't you?" asked Louise. "Well,
we did it, and maybe if you hadn't&mdash;got spilled,
I couldn't have won on the signalling. You see,
the life boat was out there watching, and they
caught my message, and just shot in&mdash;lucky for
you and me."</p>

<p>"If I knowed Captain Dave's men were out
there, I wouldn't have been so scared to death,"
Kitty said. "But anyhow, I'm goin' home,"
and she made for the door. "Good-by, nurse,
you've been real good to me. I like your
cookin' first rate, and I'll fetch you the first
mess of clams I dig," she offered.</p>

<p>The nurse was amused and interested. Kitty
had given her a new line on patients. From
the time her wet clothes had been taken from
her, Kitty had threatened to go out on the fire
escape in the hospital robe, if they were not returned
very early in the morning, and nurse
knew very well, she intended to carry out the
threat.</p>

<p>There was no bag or luggage to leave with
Kitty, neither did she dally in her exit. Rather,
she was in the car and waiting, before Margaret
and Louise could possibly get down the stairs
and reach the sidewalk.</p>

<p>"I love automobiles," said Kitty, as they
climbed in, and Leonore touched the starter.</p>

<p>"Wish you would take a longer ride," Margaret
remarked. "It would do you good."</p>

<p>"Can't, wish I could," the girl replied a bit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
wistfully. "Don't know what's happened since
I've been away. Hope Bentley was there."
Margaret then noticed an anxiety that seemed
to make a woman out of the winsome child.</p>

<p>"You're not worrying about Uncle Pete?"
asked Louise. "The girl said he was all right
last evening."</p>

<p>"Oh no, it isn't Uncle Pete I'm worrying
about," replied Kitty. But she did not attempt
to explain further, and the girls noticed the
omission.</p>

<p>Turning carefully into the little sand road
that led to the landing, Leonore slowed down.
A boy just stepped from the pavilion.</p>

<p>"Oh, there's Bentley!" shouted Kitty.
"Hello, Ben!" she called waving frantically.
No wonder she was so delighted, thought her
companions. It was almost like coming back
from the grave.</p>

<p>"Hello, Kitty," replied Bentley quickly as
he could make out the figure in the back seat
of the car. His face showed his pleasure. For
Kitty to have been snatched from the waves,
and then spend the night in the hospital, was
really an occurrence.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, wait a minute," she rattled
on. The "waits" were addressed one to Bentley
and the other to Leonore. "I'm going over
with Ben. Got your boat?"</p>

<p>"Yes, come on," called the boy, plainly glad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
to be of service to the heroine. "Uncle Pete
is at the bend. I'll row you down to him."</p>

<p>"Hello, Bentley," Louise called out. "Haven't
we had a great time?"</p>

<p>"I should say you had," he answered, cap
in hand. "You're the life saver, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"She's <i>it</i>," sang out Margaret gleefully.</p>

<p>"Oh, say, girls" (now Bentley's bashfulness
was threatening him), "did any of you lose a
bag?"</p>

<p>For a moment neither Margaret nor Louise
remembered Elizabeth's lost bag with the shoes
and stockings on the beach. Then it flashed on
Margaret&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, yes with some other things," she stammered.
"You know, Louise, Elizabeth left her
bag with the things on the beach, moonlight
bathing night&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's so," said Louise. "Why,
Bentley? Did you find a bag?"</p>

<p>"No, but I saw one in a shop, and I thought
it might belong to some one of you girls. What
sort did you lose?"</p>

<p>Neither girl knew much about the lost bag,
but Louise thought it might be a blue crochet.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's it," said Bentley. "It has a
tassel on it and it's blue. I'll get it for you
next time I go over to Jake's," he offered.</p>

<p>"Is it at Jake's?" exclaimed Kitty. "That's
where I saw the dandy pumps with buckles on,
and the swellest silk stockings. Louise, I'll get<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
the bag for you, because I'm going over to
Jake's to buy some of those things!"</p>

<p>"Oh," exclaimed Louise, in a gale of laughter.
"Those are our pumps and stockings.
They were taken off from the beach."</p>

<p>"You don't say?" and Kitty's tone allayed
any possible suspicion. "That's just like Jake.
Buys everything the boys offer, and no questions
asked, just like they say in the papers. I
tell you, I'll come around when I can," this
rather dubiously, "and I'll get you girls, and
we'll go and raid Jake. It'll do him good."</p>

<p>When she raced off with Bentley and Leonore
turned toward the village the scouts were
still shaking with laughter.</p>

<p>"We are to raid Jake's. Remember that,"
said Margaret.</p>

<p>"But we will surely have to make a contribution
to Kitty," said Louise. "She has had her
eye on your buckles, Maggie."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you see the patient all the way
home?" asked Leonore, when they stopped for
the other girls at the Post Office.</p>

<p>"Oh, why didn't we?" reiterated Louise.
"Leonore, she lives on forbidden ground. We
have had a glimpse of it and hope for more, but
we have to bide-a-wee, don't we, Margaret?
Get me a quart of those peaches," she called
out to Cleo, who seemed spellbound before a
fruit stand.</p>

<p>"And I want new apples," ordered Margaret.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
"Don't take any old cold storage stuff.
I want new ones, if they do pizen me," she
declared.</p>

<p>"How folks stare," whispered Louise. "I'll
have to leave off this handy little uniform for
a while."</p>

<p>"Not at all," protested Margaret. "We
want folks to know who we are. I feel like
giving the cheer this very minute."</p>

<p>But the return of the marketers forestalled
any such danger. Apples and peaches, and
even a big melon, were piled in the car by the
boy from the Italian fruit stand, and then Cleo
insisted on every one having a soda before going
back to Ocean Avenue.</p>

<p>The drug store, where the best soda was
served, filled many other civic needs than those
of supplying sundaes and prescriptions. It
also served as a town information bureau, and
just now, while the girls were waiting for their
order, a very pompous woman in the spickest,
spannest white duck outfit, was asking questions
from the prescription clerk.</p>

<p>The girls heard him mention "the Point" and
at this they stopped talking to "listen in."</p>

<p>"But I must get my messages as quickly as
they are received," said the white duck woman.
"It is of the utmost importance."</p>

<p>"Wireless messages have to be relayed," explained
the man, "and besides that, we can't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
always get a boat over to the place." His voice
was vindictive.</p>

<p>"All right, but please be more careful," said
the woman. "It is not a matter of money, you
know."</p>

<p>"We only have one kind of charge," fired
back the clerk rather angrily. "Our boys are
paid for their time, and that's all we ask." He
turned away to answer the telephone, and the
haughty creature left the drug store. As she
did she made no excuse for an impertinent survey
of the girls, sipping their sodas.</p>

<p>"Know us the next time," said Cleo.</p>

<p>"Surely will," added Louise.</p>

<p>"And getting wireless messages for Luna
Land! Now I'm all excited," and Margaret
tried to make use of two drug store fans, one
in each hand.</p>

<p>"It is flabbergasting," gulped Louise, finishing
her soda. "That white duck reminds me of
something."</p>

<p>"Of Kitty's nurse," Margaret exclaimed. "I
think though, the wireless one has a crackle
the hospital brand lacks. Kitty's nurse was
quite noiseless."</p>

<p>"That one wasn't, though," declared Julia.
"She had enough starch in that outfit to defy
even the Sea Crest dampness. Perhaps that
was the real idea. Come on, scouts. Do you
recall Neal is to take us out in his new launch?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>"And did you hear he is going to call it the
Treddie, after us?" added Grace.</p>

<p>"Yes, wanted to make it True Tred, but we
told him that was copyrighted," explained
Julia.</p>

<p>"Shall we dare ask for a trip to the Point?"
inquired Helen. "That was the plan you know;
first trip in the new launch."</p>

<p>"We'll see. But come on, do. Leonore, you
are a dear, to take us all about, and listen to
our prattle," Cleo told the capable driver who
had long since finished her soda, and was waiting
patiently for the younger girls.</p>

<p>"I like it," she replied with evident sincerity.</p>

<p>"You shall have a box of sunburn cream for
that," sang out Louise. "What is your brand?
Or would you rather have a talcum?"</p>

<p>Selecting from the bewildering display at
the counter of summer toilet articles consumed
still more time, until finally, realization that it
was really lunch time, the fire bell announcing
it, brought them all up sharply.</p>

<p>"Wish we had our slippers and pumps back,"
said Grace. "These emergency sneaks certainly
look the part. When did Kitty say we
were to raid Jake's?"</p>

<p>"No definite time was set, as they say about
delayed scout meetings," replied Margaret,
"but I could use my pretty buckled pumps this
very afternoon."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," Helen called to a news boy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
"We want a paper!" They always seemed to
want something when in town.</p>

<p>"Look! Look!" exclaimed Margaret, securing
the sheet while some one else paid the boy.
"We are all over the front page. Louise Hart,
we will have to appoint a body guard for you,
or the people will kidnap you. Just read this!"</p>

<p>"Oh, just listen," insisted Cleo. "It says
the Sea Crest Life Savers are going to ask
the naval authorities to acknowledge the brave
act&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Louise had fallen back in a mock faint&mdash;The
glory of the aftermath was getting a bit
too thick for comfort.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<h3>A REVELATION</h3>


<div class='cap'>"ANYWHERE you like, and the bottom,
not the sky, is the limit." It was
Neal, replying to the girls' request for
a trip to the Point in the Treddie.</div>

<p>The party included Grace, Louise, Julia,
Helen, Cleo, Isabel, Elizabeth and Corinne, the
last named having run up from the Windward,
to spend a few days with her school companions
at Sea Crest.</p>

<p>"A regular excursion," said Elizabeth.
"We should have brought eats."</p>

<p>"We may find them," suggested Neal, turning
over his engine, whereat the Treddie
chugged off.</p>

<p>"This may look like an excursion, girls,"
said Cleo, "but it feels like an expedition. I'm
quivering with excitement."</p>

<p>"And I'm all goose flesh with apprehension,"
followed Louise. "How do we know what we
are going to run into on Looney Land?"</p>

<p>"We don't. There would be no fun in it if
we did," Grace told her. "I've come armed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
If bears or lions howl at me they'll get ammonia
from my tree," she rhymed, exhibiting Benny's
water pistol.</p>

<p>"Spoof," Corinne exclaimed; "I thought we
had wild <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'terrrors'">terrors</ins> up at Windward, but we
haven't come across bears nor injuns. Wish I
had brought my illegal sling shot that I only
use in self defense."</p>

<p>"Treddie can tread," remarked Isabel.
"Who was it walked on the water?"</p>

<p>"Ancient or modern?" flipped Louise. "I'm
busy thinking of walking on air just now."</p>

<p>"Which way do you want to go first?" asked
Neal, turning a little from his steering wheel.</p>

<p>"To the Point," called Cleo.</p>

<p>"Thought we were sure, positive, no mistake,
going to Looney Land this time," grumbled
Julia.</p>

<p>"So we are but we will stop off at the Point,
and feel the lay of the land first. We may get
a line on the wild animals, you know."</p>

<p>"I like motor boating even better than sail
boating, and I thought the Blowell was perfect."
This was Cleo's comment on the Treddie's trip,
as the launch skimmed over the river and bay,
rejoicing in every wave presented to her bow.</p>

<p>"We won't get stuck on a sand bar, at any
rate," reflected Louise. "This boat has power
enough to push itself off."</p>

<p>"But we could get engine troubles," Neal
warned. "Although I don't anticipate any such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
disaster. Which one of you girls lives in the
Gordon house?" he asked presently.</p>

<p>"I do," said Grace. "Don't tell me they are
coming back for anything?"</p>

<p>"No, not just that," replied Neal; "but Dick
Gordon is my chum. He has been out with a
yachting party all summer, the Altons of New
York, you know, and I had a line from his last
port. He will be back in about a week. I'm
awfully anxious to see him. We have great
times always, but he got in service, through the
Canadian lines, and I got&mdash;left, so I haven't
seen Dick since."</p>

<p>"They took very young boys in the Canadian
service just before the armistice I know," said
Cleo, "for my seventeen-year-old brother ran
over there, and got the 'wings' the day before
Peace Day."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is how Dick made it," explained
Neal. "But now he's getting back, a little late
but mighty welcome."</p>

<p>"I suppose he will want a look at his old
room," said Grace. "It is just as he left it, I
believe."</p>

<p>"Yes, Dick has a hobby for sea stuff, and
his marine room was his pride. But he won't
bother you folks any; he isn't that sort," said
Neal.</p>

<p>"Now Grazie," teased Elizabeth, "look out
for your window."</p>

<p>"Rather I'll leave a love note on the sill, like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
the lady-faire of old," retorted Grace. "At any
rate he is apt to call on me."</p>

<p>"Here we are at the Point," called out Julia.
"Don't fall overboard in landing."</p>

<p>"If you want to go in at the island, after you
have looked around here, there is a perfect stone
arch at the other end. I'll take you over that
way, if you like. It's one of the prettiest spots
around here," suggested Neal.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, that will be splendid," Louise answered.
"We have seen the island from two
sides, and that must be at the extreme other
end."</p>

<p>There was no visible apprehension expressed
in the way the girls landed at the point, and if
they experienced such emotion, it was thoroughly
disguised, for as a troop they simply besieged
the strip of land, with one grand, vigorous
yell.</p>

<p>No Tenderfoots seemed included, but rather
seasoned woodsmen; eager to climb, to beat
down trails, "to confront the enemy" with open
or closed fists&mdash;such daring indeed was manifested
in their act of possession.</p>

<p>"I'm so glad we came in at this end," said
Cleo. "With all that shouting the little woman
at the ice cream stand might take fright and go.
Then what would we do for eats?"</p>

<p>"Oh, there comes the carrier pigeon!" explained
Grace. "Come on to the birches. See,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
he is going to land in there, same as he did before."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's Lovey," declared Cleo. "I'm so
glad all the girls will have a chance to see him.
Hurry, and don't make too much noise."</p>

<p>The graceful little gray dove was floating
through the air, without a flutter of wing&mdash;just
sailing on the breeze. Following Cleo's lead
the girls made their way through the thicket,
and presently were in the low, soft, velvety
patch, the sort of maiden-hair grass that grows
under the trees.</p>

<p>"Here we are," almost whispered Isabel, for
the bird was about settled on a tuft of meadow
grass.</p>

<p>"Oh, here's Kitty!" exclaimed Grace. "Kitty
girl, what are you hiding from?"</p>

<p>And there, crouched at the foot of a tree was
Kitty. She looked like nothing so much as a
toad-stool, a bit of human fungus growth, at
the foot of that gentle birch tree. Her knees
drawn up, and bare feet hiding in her
bedraggled gingham skirt, Kitty was truly a
sorry looking figure.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Isabel. The girls had
grouped themselves around in semi-circle, and
even Lovey, the waiting messenger, was for the
moment forgotten.</p>

<p>Kitty raised her head and confessed to a pair
of very red eyes. Her lips were trembling and
the little cords of her face twitching.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>"I heard a racket, and thought she had sent
them after me," stammered Kitty. "But it was
only you," and just the glint of a smile played
through her grief.</p>

<p>"Who was coming after you? Whom did
you fear, Kitty? Tell us!" asked Louise,
slipping down on the green, beside the crouching
figure.</p>

<p>"Aunt Hannah. She came back from New
York, and we didn't expect her. Somehow she
found out about&mdash;about the accident, and she
was furious."</p>

<p>"Your Aunt Hannah?" pressed Grace. The
girls sensed tragedy now.</p>

<p>"Says she is, but she ain't, I'm going to ask
Captain Dave for my papers and prove it."
Kitty was recovering her courage, perhaps at
the thought of battle.</p>

<p>Louise longed to throw her arms about the
child and tell her that her precious papers were
that very moment in the Hart family safe, but
she knew the time had not come for the revelation.</p>

<p>"And she said she'd send them after me,"
moaned Kitty. "So I'm goin' to run away."</p>

<p>"Send whom after you?" followed Corinne.</p>

<p>"The reform school people, and I would be
put behind bars for life." The sharp dark eyes
gleamed until it seemed sparks would fly, but
they were glints of pure terror, the girl was
panic-stricken.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>"Just don't you worry, Kitty. We'll stand
by you, and you shall never be put in such a
place," Julia assured her. "Have you forgotten
Captain Dave?"</p>

<p>"No, but she is so much smarter than any
one else. And I can't get off this Point without
she sees me, and then she might send the police
after me."</p>

<p>That the fearful threat had been held over
poor Kitty's head was now easily guessed&mdash;perhaps
this was why she had been so secretive
about Luna Land?</p>

<p>"I'll run down to the dock and tell Neal to
sail around the bay for a half hour," suggested
Cleo. "Then, we can sit right down and talk
things over with Kitty."</p>

<p>"And here is Lovey with a letter from Bentley,"
said Kitty, now turning to the pigeon that
had been hopping about, and picking at invisible
bugs. "Whatever would I have done without
Bentley. Come, Lovey!"</p>

<p>Tame as a kitten the pigeon strutted up to
Kitty's hand. She fondled it, gave it some
crumbs from her pocket, then, from under the
gray and white wing took the tiny quill that held
the message.</p>

<p>Cleo had returned, and the girls looked on in
wonder, while Kitty unrolled the little slip, and
deciphered the message.</p>

<p>"Yes, she's over there yet, Bentley says.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
And Royal is crying for me." At this she threw
up the tousled head and glared defiance.</p>

<p>"I'm going right back," she cried. "She
shan't scare me off now. That's just what she
wants to do. She wants to steal Royal away,
but she shan't, she shan't!" and only a hold on
Kitty's arm, made as the girls realized she was
running off, held her for another moment.</p>

<p>"Who is Royal?" demanded Cleo. "Tell us!
We must know."</p>

<p>"I can't tell you. I'm pledged not to, and
don't you think I have to keep a pledge? Do
I?" This last was almost an appeal.</p>

<p>"If it is a good pledge," answered Louise
quickly.</p>

<p>"I don't know whether it is good or bad,"
said Kitty freeing herself, "but I know I must
get to Royal."</p>

<p>"Can't we go with you?" asked Grace. "We
are not afraid of any old Aunt Hannahs."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no, please, not yet. That would be
so much worse. I have to be so tricky to save
Royal, and if she suspected me I would lose
everything. Not that I care for her old hundred
dollars now. I wouldn't even take it," she
declared.</p>

<p>The girls were puzzled. Royal, it appeared,
must be some child that Kitty was protecting,
and this woman was holding a threatening club
over Kitty's head.</p>

<p>"Are you positive we can't come right over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
there and fight things out for you, Kitty?"
asked Grace with a brave voice. "We have been
waiting around here all summer for that sort
of thing."</p>

<p>"No, no," wailed the child, now running toward
the little skiff which lay under the willow
at the water's edge. "I'll call you if I get in
trouble. See that high rock over on the far side
of the island? Well, you can see that all the
way from Sea Crest, and if you see a lantern
hanging in that tree to-night, come. If it's day-time
I'll put a white flag up, and the wind will
wave it, but I don't believe she'll make trouble
just now. All I was afraid of was being put
away, and now I see why she said that. She just
wanted me to run away. But I shan't. I'll
stay, and I'll take care of little Royal."</p>

<p>She was gone. Her oars lapped the waves
and sent back their brave message as she turned
into the cove that faced Luna Land.</p>

<p>"Well, of all things!" exclaimed Cleo.</p>

<p>"I expected you to say something a little
more original," remarked Grace. "But I don't
quite blame you. It is bewildering."</p>

<p>"And Royal!" repeated Helen. "Royal
made our signs and played with the little
tools!"</p>

<p>"And signed his name Peter Pan," recalled
Louise.</p>

<p>"Why should Kitty be watching a child with
such a swell name?" queried Julia.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why all the other things?" replied Elizabeth.</p>

<p>"There's Neal's toot. We must go," announced
Isabel.</p>

<p>"I wish we could circle around the island,"
suggested Cleo. "No harm in that, surely.
Every one goes as they please on the bay."</p>

<p>"Grand idea!" exclaimed Helen. "Maybe
we could see into the island from the boat.
Come on. Hope Neal has some more time to
spare."</p>

<p>The owner of the Treddie was glad to circle
the little isle, and when all had jumped in the
launch, the trip home began with that preliminary
dash.</p>

<p>"I'll slow down so you can get a good look,"
Neal told them, and he understood enough about
the interest in Luna Land to do his part.</p>

<p>All eyes were strained toward the shore.</p>

<p>"There's the pretty, rocky ledge Neal told
us about," remarked Isabel. "Just see! It's
like a movie rock. What a pretty arch it forms."</p>

<p>But even the natural beauty of the rocky
alcove did not furnish the point of interest they
searched for.</p>

<p>"Would you imagine that place hid human
life?" said Cleo, a little disappointed. "Not
even a tree branch moves."</p>

<p>"Dense foliage," added Grace. "It would be
pretty hard to see anything through those
trees."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>The launch was covering the last strip of
water that lapped the island. Every one seemed
tense with an anxious sort of interest.</p>

<p>Suddenly Helen jumped up.</p>

<p>"Look," she called. "Over by the arch!"</p>

<p>"The white duck lady!" cried Cleo. "See,
she is looking at us through glasses."</p>

<p>"Sit down Helen," ordered Grace. "Don't
pretend we are interested, or she will know this
launch."</p>

<p>They were not far from the shore, and it was
easy to discern the figure on the rock, who evidently
used the glasses to make sure of the faces
in the launch.</p>

<p>"Maybe she's looking for her wireless," said
Isabel.</p>

<p>"Well, I am doubly sorry for Kitty if that's
Aunt Hannah," declared Julia, and then the
Treddie left Luna Land behind.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<h3>ON LUNA LAND</h3>


<div class='cap'>GRACE tapped at the side window of the
Log Cabin; she had climbed over the
little stile-steps that mounted the fence
between Rosabell and Cleo's cottage, and now
she waited at the window for a sign of life
within, for it was early, and summer folks could
sleep late. Her round dimpled face was pressed
to the pane with a rather serious look, and anyone
might know to see her, that Grace was
troubled.</div>

<p>Cleo answered the call, throwing open the
latticed window, and almost kissing Grace in
the act.</p>

<p>"Come in, Grazia. Why so early? Looking
for the story book worm?" Cleo greeted.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you are not out&mdash;on the lake I
mean," answered Grace. "I'll come around to
the side porch, Cleo, I must talk with you."</p>

<p>On the big swing made of interlaced white
birchwood, the two chums perched, and Grace
promptly undertook to unburden her mind.</p>

<p>"Cleo dear," she said, "I am so worried<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
about Kitty. How do we know but that woman
may have locked her up, or something?"</p>

<p>"Strange, Grazia, I have been thinking just
that myself. But how are we to find out without
jeopardizing Kitty's interests? She begged
us not to go over there."</p>

<p>"I know, Cleo, but I have a plan. You and I
can go to the Point. We will ask Tommie Johnston
to row us over. He would not be busy so
early, and a row boat doesn't make any noise.
Then, we can go over to the island, and just
feel our way around."</p>

<p>"Splendid," agreed Cleo. "I'll be ready in
a jiffy. Are you ready?"</p>

<p>"Just have to tell Benny I'm going up the
river," replied Grace. "We can easily be back
in an hour."</p>

<p>Tommie Johnston could go, and was glad to
give the girls a sail in his freshly-painted boat,
but he wagged his head seriously when Cleo said
she had a message for Kitty, and was going to
take it straight over to the island.</p>

<p>"Miss Morehouse is over there," he said in
warning, "I saw her sailin' around in her hospital
clothes yesterday."</p>

<p>"We don't mind. Is she Aunt Hannah?"
Cleo asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's the dame. Miss Hannah Morehouse,
boss of <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Luney'">Looney</ins> Land," replied Tommie,
"and you've got a lot of nerve to trespass on
her territory. She's mighty strict."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>"We are going to try it," insisted Grace,
whereat Tommie pulled harder than ever on
his oars.</p>

<p>They stopped at the Point but everything was
quiet there, if the wildest chirping of birds,
and fluttering of all feathered creatures be overlooked.
Before the human world moves birds
seem happiest, and surely wildest, so that on
the dewy summer morning, Grace and Cleo
stepped onto the Point and into a perfect medley
of bird language.</p>

<p>"No one around here," commented Cleo.
"Don't let us waste time."</p>

<p>They hurried back to Tommie's boat, just in
time to see a launch cut by. In it was the white
duck woman, Miss Hannah Morehouse.</p>

<p>"There she goes," said Tommie, with abroad
and noisy grin. "You're in luck."</p>

<p>"And we are glad of it," admitted Cleo,
popping into the boat.</p>

<p>"Which side shall we land at?" asked the
boat man, as they brushed the sandy shore.</p>

<p>"We don't know," answered Cleo. "Which
way do you think is best? We would like to get
on a quiet end, not near the cottages, if there
are any?" said Grace.</p>

<p>"Don't know much about it," said Tommie.
"But I guess the far end is best&mdash;over by the
Cave of the Winds," he finished, pointing his
boat toward the rocky arch on the far side of
the little island.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>The two scouts stepped cautiously ashore.
That end of the island was banked with huge
rocks that shot up almost straight, forming a
natural fort, with the rugged, artistic arch at
its base. Under the arch Grace and Cleo felt
their way, and their attention was almost immediately
arrested by a series of the pasteboard
cards, signed "Peter Pan."</p>

<p>"Little Royal's work," said Grace quietly.
"Wonder if we shall see him?"</p>

<p>Up from the rocks a sparkling little stream
played. <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'It's'">Its</ins> origin was a spring under a hill,
and as it trickled along, in the tender growth
of green, the girls felt instinctively the beauty
of the little spot so hidden and isolated from
the inhabitants of Sea Crest.</p>

<p>"Lovely!" breathed Cleo. "Little Royal
could hardly be lonely here."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, he could," contradicted Grace. "A
child wants more than scenery to play with."</p>

<p>They had gone but a short distance in the
woods when something was heard threshing
through the bushes.</p>

<p>"It's he," said Cleo, and she secretly hoped
no armed caretaker might appear with the child.</p>

<p>A sudden swish, then from under a tangled
elderberry bush there emerged a darling little
boy. At the sight of the intruders he stood
stock still in evident amazement.</p>

<p>"Oh, I knew you would come!" he exclaimed,
clapping his little hands in glee. "I knew my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
letters would reach you! What are your names,
fairies? Please tell me, and are we going right
now to Mama?"</p>

<p>"How do you do, little boy," said Cleo. "Are
you Royal?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm Royal, and I know who you are.
I've been expecting you a very long time."</p>

<p>He came forward a little hesitatingly. Grace
could not resist rushing up to him and throwing
her arms about the pretty child.</p>

<p>"Oh, you perfectly darling little boy," she
exclaimed. "We know who you are, for Kitty
has told us," and she hugged him quite indecorously
for a fairy.</p>

<p>He was so pretty. His light hair cropped at
his ears did not succeed in preventing curls to
tangle and his blue eyes were roguish as even
a baby boy's should be. With these unerring
features his color reflected the outdoor treatment,
and his little form evinced unmistakably
that quality for which we have no better term
than "good breeding."</p>

<p>Cleo stooped to pay her homage, and when
Grace released Royal she caught him up.</p>

<p>"Why do you want to go to mama?" she
asked. "Where is mama?"</p>

<p>"Oh, far away, and she cannot get back till
the Royal comes in. Her boat is Royal too,"
he said proudly.</p>

<p>"And who takes care of you?" pressed Grace,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
keeping in mind the prospect of almost any interruptions
spoiling this valued confidence.</p>

<p>"Kitty-dear does. There is <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Hanorah'">Hannah</ins>, of
course, but I don't like her, and I do like Kitty-dear,"
he said, with a brave echo in his childish
voice.</p>

<p>"And where do you live? Where is your
house?" Cleo was peering through the trees,
but could see no sign of anything like a dwelling.</p>

<p>"Oh, I haven't any house; I must live outdoors.
Dr. Grant ordered it, and I must roll
in the mud. But I get tired rolling, and there
isn't any real mud here, except what Kitty-dear
fetches in the boat. Then we make mud pies,
and that's fun. But you are going to take me
for a boat ride now, aren't you? I have wanted
one for such a long time." His voice was wistful,
and his blue eyes were fastened on the boat,
that through the trees could be seen, rocking on
the water's edge, where Tommie waited.</p>

<p>"Where is Kitty?" asked Cleo without answering
the appeal for a long delayed boat ride.</p>

<p>"She's busy with Uncle Pete," replied Royal.
"Hannah wants lots of things done when she
comes, but sometimes she gives Kitty-dear
money, then we have cookies, but we never dare
tell Hannah, 'cause I'm not allowed cookies,"
he said with a cute twist of his yellow head.
"But you are the fairies who took my letters,
aren't you? I knew when they were gone from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
their letter boxes on the birch trees, that I would
surely get an answer! And see, I was right!"</p>

<p>"I think I hear Kitty coming," said Grace.
"Yes, here she is."</p>

<p>"Well, I never," called Kitty gleefully.
"Look who blew in!"</p>

<p>"Hello, Kitty," called back Cleo, delighted
to notice the high spirits Kitty flaunted. "We
just did blow in from the bay to make a very
early call. Hope we haven't interrupted any
gardening?" This applied to Kitty's outfit, for
she wore blue overalls, and a boy's cap, that
looked better on her cropped head than could
any other sort of hat, and her bare feet completed
a really charming rustic picture.</p>

<p>"Gardening, you said it!" exclaimed Kitty
in pardonable slang. "That's what I have to
do when 'her nibs' is in town. But thank goodness
she's out for the day, and may have to run
up to the city" (this in a mocking tone). "I
hope she does, and I hope she gets tripped up
in the run so she can't get back for a while.
What do you think of my little Royal? I call
him little Boy Blue, and he calls me Bo Peep,
don't we have good times, Roy?"</p>

<p>In answer the small boy rubbed his head
against Kitty's overalls, like a fond little
kitten.</p>

<p>"We felt we must see you, Kitty," said Cleo
seriously, "and we'll have to talk fast, as we
left home so early and have to get back. Tommie<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
is in the boat, and he too, must get back to the
landing. Kitty, are you all right? and is everything
all right?"</p>

<p>"Pretty much," said Kitty with a little wink
in Royal's direction. "I'm glad you came and
would&mdash;you&mdash;like to see our lodgings?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid we can't wait this time," said
Grace thinking it would be like Brother Benny
to raise a still alarm that Grace had gone to
that Looney Land. "But we can come back
again soon."</p>

<p>"You are going to take me with you," gleefully
announced the boy making a start toward
the rocky arch.</p>

<p>"Oh, Roy dear, you wouldn't leave Kitty,"
protested the little caretaker. "You know we
are both going together&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But these are my fairies," and tears welled
into the saucer blue eyes. "I can't&mdash;can't let
them go away!" Two monster tears rolled
right into the quivering lips.</p>

<p>Cleo and Grace felt very helpless in this sort
of predicament. It was one thing to dive off
piers, and fish boys or girls out of the depths,
but how to bank a flood of baby tears?</p>

<p>Kitty knew. She took Royal in her arms and
attempted to hoist him up a tree.</p>

<p>"Peter Pan," she said severely. "See that
cloud floating by! That's our airship, and very,
very soon I promise we shall go to mother's
land&mdash;in our ship of love. You see, these are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
the messenger fairies (she did not know what
truth she spoke,) and they will soon return,"
she finished grandly.</p>

<p>Grace and Cleo felt impelled to be fairies, and
each raised fluttering arms, saved from comic
effect by the love they betrayed in their smiling
assent.</p>

<p>"Yes, we surely will come back very soon,"
declared Grace. "And Little Peter Pan, you
may watch us from your tree. We have a power
boat&mdash;and a row boat&mdash;you can tell us by a
signal. When we come we will wave a blue flag&mdash;a
light blue one, like a piece of the sky,"
finished Grace.</p>

<p>"All right," said the child, a little dolefully.
"But I sat in the tree so often in my nighty,
and Kitty-dear built steps so I could go up and
down&mdash;" He paused, and bravely brushed
away another big tear, with a motion that indicated
dislike for feeble symbols.</p>

<p>"Well hurry," said Cleo, seizing the chance
of escape. "Good-bye little Royal-Boy-Blue-Peter
Pan," she said merrily. "And good-bye,
Kitty. Send a letter by Lovey dove, or by Bentley,
and we will answer promptly."</p>

<p>Kitty understood, and as they turned for a
last look before stepping into Tommie's boat,
they saw her holding Royal, as high on her
shoulder as she could prop him; and he was
wildly waving Kitty's blue cap.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<h3>A COMEDY OF THE ROCKS</h3>


<div class='cap'>"OH, I am so excited, Cleo. Everything is
happening at once. The girls have been
down to Captain Dave's and he was delighted
with his pipe and things, and Neal
seized the loving cup. Says it belongs to his
club, the one Dick Gordon was in. And&mdash;"
she paused for breath, Cleo jumped in the
opening.</div>

<p>"Grazia, dear, don't choke. I am all of a
flutter myself. Louise has had her father look
over Kitty's papers, and it is almost too commonplace
to tell, but it is just perfectly lovely,
all the same. The name 'Schulkill' is on the
deed to the property over at Luna Land, and
the name Morehouse, that's the Aunt Hannah
and Uncle Pete name, is only told of in Kitty's
mother's letters. It will be very easy to establish
Kitty's claim, Mr. Hart thinks, and Louise
is so full of the news she wants to fly back to
the island to tell Kitty without waiting for the
message."</p>

<p>"I don't blame her. We hoped there would
be one important paper in that packet, there always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
is, else why all the tin box care? But
isn't it strange a man like benevolent old Captain
Dave never suspected such a thing? Men
just seem to think women carry tin boxes out of
shipwrecks to take care of hair pins, and little
things like that."</p>

<p>"I told the girls to wear their uniforms and
Neal promised to take us all over this afternoon,"
Cleo continued. "Oh, Grace, I never
quite expected so much excitement, but I must
admit I love it," said the courageous scout.</p>

<p>How the True Treds congregated, ready for
the sail over the bay in the valiant <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Teddie'">Treddie</ins> need
not be told, for the very next noticeable thing
was they were all together, and ready for a
start, piling into the launch, like an encore to
their previous excursion. Everybody chatted,
and chinned, and giggled, and asked questions;
and the sky blue flag Grace carried folded in her
blouse caused no end of comment.</p>

<p>"Louise has had a double share of glory,"
said Helen, adding more to the share in her
own tone of admiration. "She made a rescue,
and found Kitty's deed to Luna Land."</p>

<p>"But the curtain is not rung down yet," Cleo
reminded her. "No telling what may happen
this very afternoon."</p>

<p>The boat clipped the waves so merrily the
Point loomed in view almost before the girls
realized they had entered the cove.</p>

<p>"There's Bentley!" called Grace. "See, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
is just standing on the dock, and he has a suitcase.
Turn in there a minute, Neal, please. We
would speak to him."</p>

<p>Quickly as he spied the Treddie, Bentley
waved his cap in signal for them to come in.</p>

<p>"There," added Cleo; "he has a message, I
think. See, he has a paper in his hand."</p>

<p>"Don't get out," the boy called. "I'll throw
it in," and wrapping a piece of paper weighted
with a pebble, around the smaller slip, he easily
tossed the message into Julia's lap.</p>

<p>"It's addressed to the scouts," said Louise.
"You read it, Cleo."</p>

<p>The engine had not been turned off, so that it
readily picked up speed again, as the girls
waved gayly to Bentley. Cleo smoothed out the
little note anxiously, and every one saw it was
written on the old-time yellow paper. Cleo read
aloud:</p>

<p>"Bentley is going home and I won't stay here
any longer. Watch for my wig-wag signal
from the stone arch, and come to rescue me and
Royal. Must watch for chance. About three,
maybe." It was signed "Kitty."</p>

<p>"Another wig-wag rescue," repeated Helen,
fluttering with excitement. "Won't it be splendid
to take them both away?"</p>

<p>"But what shall we do with them?" asked
Isabel. "I know one doesn't dare take even a
lost child indoors without danger of arrest."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then we'll keep them on the porch," replied
Cleo crisply.</p>

<p>"And we can notify Captain Dave or even
our police officer. Then there will be no possibility
of complications," said Louise.</p>

<p>Another swing around the tail of the point,
and Luna Land lay before them. All eyes were
strained toward the rocky summit over the arch.</p>

<p>"I see her!" shouted Julia. "Remember <i>I</i>
saw her first," and she stood to wave her camp
hat in one hand and a handkerchief in the other.</p>

<p>"Yes," added Grace, throwing the blue
cheesecloth to the breeze, "there they are!"
Kitty was waving her white flag against the
green foliage background. "Oh, Neal go in
quickly. Some one may catch them before we
can reach them."</p>

<p>Not another word was spoken until the launch
scraped the rocks.</p>

<p>"Stay where you are!" called Kitty. "We
have to jump."</p>

<p>"Why? They may be hurt," protested Elizabeth.
But her companions had realized the
situation. Kitty wanted to reach the launch
from the secluded corner of the rock, and would
not risk embarking from the natural landing,
with its view all open.</p>

<p>"Can we take the canvas?" Isabel asked
Neal. A nod of his head gave permission, and
before he seemed to know just what they were
going to do, four of the girls had leapt to land.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
Cleo and Helen then tossed the bundled piece
of awning over the side of the Treddie, and
safely ashore, then climbed out themselves, and,
like the firemen under burning buildings, stood
the True Treds, with that big piece of canvas
stretched under the leafy peak of the rocky
archway.</p>

<p>"Ready!" called out Kitty.</p>

<p>A firmer grasp was made at every holding
point, and then&mdash;a gentle thud.</p>

<p>Little Royal bounced like a circus baby in the
life net.</p>

<p>Quickly two girls lifted him out and turned
down to the launch, while the others held the net
for Kitty, who came in with a jump that brought
the rescuers to their knees, stifling a gale of
laughter.</p>

<p>"All right&mdash;no bones broken," gasped Kitty.
"Hurry, they may be after us!"</p>

<p>Quickly they all scrambled in the launch,
while little Royal was in Neal's arms.</p>

<p>"I knew it, I knew it," he kept repeating.
"And this is just like daddy's little boat&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Girls!" exclaimed Kitty, "I found your
slippers and stockings and the bag among Aunt
Hannah's things. They're in my bag."</p>

<p>"Where is she?" Cleo asked, too impatient to
wait for a more opportune moment.</p>

<p>"She came back ready to take Roy away,"
Kitty said defiantly. "But I wouldn't trust
her. I found a lot of papers and wireless messages,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
and I wouldn't let her sneak off with
Royal. I just made up my mind she couldn't
scare me any more, and I'd go to Uncle Dave's,
and tell him all about it."</p>

<p>"You are right," declared Louise. "I don't
know very much about it, but it can do no harm
for this little darling to leave that island. He
was a regular prisoner there."</p>

<p>"You said it!" replied Kitty. "And having
the poor angel roll in the mud to get strong!
Then sleeping in a hut to be outdoors, when I
know positive, his folks paid her thousands of
dollars to keep their child in a delightful high-class
retreat&mdash;where everything was perfect,
but very costly."</p>

<p>"Oh, was that it?" asked Grace, looking at
little Royal, as he helped steer the boat.</p>

<p>"Yes, and more," insisted Kitty, her cheeks
flaming with excitement. "She promised me a
hundred dollars if I would keep every one off
the island and look out for Roy. I thought it
was a lot, but what about her thousands? Then,
when I got in the accident the other day, and
she was afraid folks might come here to see if
I had pneumonia, she changed her mind, and refused
to give me any money. Now she is back,
and I know Royal's folks will soon be in New
York and I just wouldn't trust her with him
any more. That's why I had to ask you to
rescue us. And you did!"</p>

<p>In spite of her excitement she could laugh,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
and the humor presently became an acute infection
for every one was shouting at the
comedy of the rocks. And Kitty looked so funny.
She was dressed up, had shoes and stockings
on, and a "warmed over" hat, with
pathetically drooping roses around it; and then
the bag, with the long, lost slippers!</p>

<p>"Come to my house first," insisted Grace.
"I'm nearest."</p>

<p>"I am to meet my friend this afternoon,"
said Neal, who was so busy with the boy and his
engine he had never even heard the child's name
mentioned. "He got in this morning after a
stormy trip," went on the young man, "but his
yacht, the Royal, made it all right, and Dick
promised to be down late this afternoon."</p>

<p>"The Royal!" gasped Kitty, Grace and
Louise.</p>

<p>"That's my yacht," sang out the boy gleefully.
"Daddy and Mother and Ricky are coming
home on the Royal!"</p>

<p>"Oh joy!" shouted Louise, while Kitty
gasped.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say the young man who
runs the yacht is coming to see you?" She
had seized Neal's shoulders as if to confront
him with some horrible crime.</p>

<p>"Careful," he said with a laugh. "You'll
steer us against the dock. Yes, Richard Gordon
who runs the Alton's yacht, Royal, is my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
friend," he answered, beginning to sense the
true meaning of the affair.</p>

<p>Five minutes later it was a queer little procession
that wended the short way from the
landing to Rosabell cottage.</p>

<p>"I would like you to have seen the old
dump," said Kitty, referring to Luna Land,
"but I'll never go back there while Hannah is
around. It's only a couple of shacks. Nothing
to see but Bentley's camp. You see," in answer
to the unspoken inquiry, "Bentley is an
awful smart boy, who had to be taken out of
school. He has a nice, good-natured big brother,
Roger, who came down here, rented land from
Uncle Pete, and pitched a couple of tents on
Luna Land. They were on the other side of
the island, but Ben had the carrier pigeons and
we made up all kinds of outdoor games and he
let me use all the yellow paper I wanted. He's
gone back home, all well and ready for High
School." This last sentence seemed to evoke a
sigh from Kitty.</p>

<p>"That was why he had his book always with
him," said Cleo, and they turned the corner to
Rosabell.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<h3>SCOUTS EVERY ONE</h3>


<div class='cap'>"WE have company," said Grace, noticing
rather resentfully, that a strange figure
occupied a corner of her porch. "And
it's a man!"</div>

<p>They were almost up to the steps. Evidently
Mrs. Philow was very much interested with her
guest, for she could be seen gesticulating earnestly.</p>

<p>The girls quickened their steps and as they
approached the figure turned, caught sight of
the party of scouts, and stood with his cap in
hand.</p>

<p>"It's Ricky!" cried Royal, breaking away
from Kitty's hold and running to the young
man, who now stared in undisguised amazement.</p>

<p>"Royal!" he called in answer. "As I live,
our own little Royal!"</p>

<p>"Well," gasped Neal, attempting to get his
greeting in. "Isn't this rather a surprise?"</p>

<p>"I should say so," answered his friend.
"However did our bonny boy turn up here? I
have burned out my wireless trying to get a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
word about him. Mrs. Alton is almost ill again
worrying. Where have you been?" He was
looking over the child with a familiar and critical
eye.</p>

<p>"I've been in the woods with Kitty, rolling
in the mud and sleeping in a tree hammock,"
announced the boy proudly. "And, please,
Ricky, I'm going to take Kitty home with me.
She hasn't any nice girl's things in the woods."</p>

<p>Mrs. Philow and Leonore were standing waiting
for an opportunity to extend hospitality.</p>

<p>"This young man just came to take a peek
at his old room, Grace," the mother explained.
"You see, he is the Mr. Gordon we have been
hearing about, and now to think everybody
knows everybody&mdash;"</p>

<p>Leonore was blushing prettily. Neal had
stepped aside to speak with her. No doubt, he
was praising the running of his launch, and inviting
her to try it.</p>

<p>Kitty edged up to Royal and pinched his fat
little leg. "You're not going to give me up, are
you?" she said timidly.</p>

<p>"Nopy-nope!" answered Royal. "You must
come too. Ricky, where is mother? Take me
to her."</p>

<p>"I am going to do just that," replied the
good-looking sailor.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, please don't," begged Kitty. "I
couldn't let Roy go out of my sight&mdash;I
wouldn't," she protested.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>"But you may all come along. How would
that be?" replied Richard Gordon. "My
launch is lying at the pier, and the Royal is at
anchor just over there."</p>

<p>"And is our big yacht out there?" asked the
little boy.</p>

<p>"Surest thing," answered the yachtsman.</p>

<p>"But how do I know&mdash;know you are not a
kidnapper?" Kitty stammered suddenly.</p>

<p>Every one laughed, but Kitty's distress was
genuine.</p>

<p>"He is not a kidnapper, Kitty. He is my
Ricky," said Royal. "Please hurry and take
me to mother."</p>

<p>The girls were too surprised at the whole proceedings
to venture any suggestion, but upon
being pressed by Neal and Dick, it was arranged
that all hands should take a flying trip
out to the launch, and see Royal presented to
his mother.</p>

<p>Kitty objected&mdash;said she was afraid of the
ocean, and made other excuses, but when she
finally realized that the little boy would be
taken off without her if she did not go, she at
last consented.</p>

<p>"Another excursion," called out Cleo. "Come
on girls, the more the merrier," and chaperoned
by Leonore, the party undertook that delightful
sight&mdash;seeing a millionaire's yacht.</p>

<p>A more dramatic picture than Kitty on that
wonderful yacht can scarcely be imagined. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
was awe-inspiring to every one, but to this
quaint, picturesque little figure, it was nothing
short of marvellous. Once Royal saw the
slender, dainty little woman, he called "Muzzer"
there was no longer any doubt as to the
genuineness of the claim, in Kitty's mind.</p>

<p>"Yep," she said. "That's the lady he talked
about, that's his mother."</p>

<p>"And to think I would have sailed away again
without my baby, but for you," said Mrs. Alton
to Kitty. "How can I ever thank you?"</p>

<p>"I loved him, and we had good times," explained
the girl, "but I would never have been
brave enough to get away from Aunt Hannah
but for these scouts. I'm going to be a Girl
Scout as soon as I get in a higher grade," she
said emphatically.</p>

<p>It was quite a task to decide what to do with
Kitty. They finally arranged that the two
young men, Neal and Dick, would run around
to the island, and brave the fury of Miss Hannah
Morehouse, in a manner calculated to quiet any
possible objections on her part. In fact Royal's
father sent a very strong message, charging her
with misusing the funds given in her charge, to
be expended for his little son.</p>

<p>"The whole proceeding is an outrage," declared
the millionaire. "When the doctor
ordered a sea voyage for my wife, and said it
would be injurious to the child, this woman<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
made plans to take the boy, live in the open,
and roll in the mud and so forth."</p>

<p>"She did that all right," broke in Kitty.</p>

<p>"It seemed feasible," he continued, "and
while she said it would be costly&mdash;that did not
matter," turning to the group. "Why, I feel
only the brave fight of this child has saved him
for us. And I am not sure what course I shall
pursue in dealing with Hannah Morehouse."</p>

<p>"Only Daddy!" begged the golden-haired
boy, who clung to his mother, "please don't let
her come around here. She's too mean to Kitty
and me, and we don't ever want to see her
again, do we Kitty-dear?"</p>

<p>"All ashore, who are going ashore!" called
out Neal, and at that the happy party climbed
back into the Runner, the auxiliary launch
of the yacht, Royal, and in a few minutes were
again at Sea Crest.</p>

<p>"And you can come back with me, Kitty,"
begged Julia. "I have a big house and you can
have a room to yourself until you are ready to
go to school as Mrs. Alton wishes to arrange."</p>

<p>"And Kitty," said Louise, when the bewildered
child was quiet enough to listen, "you
need not worry about the hundred dollars Miss
Hannah refuses to pay you for you own a lot
of property on Luna Land."</p>

<p>"Aunt Hannah's property!" she gasped. "I
knew it. I'll run her off the place, but I'll build
a nice little house for good old Uncle Pete."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>"Here's your bag," said Grace; "don't lose
it."</p>

<p>"Oh, wait, girls, sit down until I give you
your stockings and things." They dropped
down on the terrace, and she dragged the things
from her bag. She drew a purse from the very
bottom of the satchel, and looked around before
she opened it.</p>

<p>"Now wait," she said again, biting her thin
lips. Then she pulled out a piece of yellow
paper from a rusty leather purse.</p>

<p>"Our fire-bug threat," exclaimed Louise.
"How did you get that?"</p>

<p>"I wanted to tell you long ago, I was the
Weasle, but it wasn't all my fault. Aunt
Hannah said if I acted queer folks would shun
me, and then I didn't have to worry so about
hiding Royal.</p>

<p>"When I got started at it, it seemed like fun.
I had no girl friends, and I liked to scare the
others, so I used to fix fires on the beach, and
let them get fanned into flames by the wind.
But I never set fire to chicken coops, and those
other places. I guess robbers did that. Then,
as soon as you girls came around, and acted so
brave about it, I saw it was more fun to have
friends than to scare them off," she finished
with an expression of genuine contrition.</p>

<p>"Well, it's all right now, Kitty, and you have
been very brave to watch so faithfully over
Royal. That was good scouting," said Isabel.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>"But think of Louise saving my life from
the pier?" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"And what a fine moving picture we all made
holding that life net for you this afternoon,"
Cleo reminded her, laughingly.</p>

<p>"I can't quite believe it about the papers,"
Kitty reflected aloud.</p>

<p>"The tin box is in my daddy's safe, but the
deeds to Luna Land are being searched by
lawyers," explained Louise.</p>

<p>"Suppose we stop at Captain Dave's and
tell him all the news first," suggested Margaret.</p>

<p>"All agreed!" called Helen and it was almost
sun down before the group in front of the station,
with Kitty Schulkill as a centerpiece, disturbed
the picture.</p>

<p>It was the end of a day, the end of a vacation,
and is the end of our story, until we meet the
happy little group in our next volume, to be
called "<span class="smcap">The Girl Scouts at Camp Comalong</span>."</p>

<h2>NOBODY'S<br />
GIRL</h2>

<div class='center'>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br />
<b>By HECTOR MALOT</b><br />
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</div>
<div class='unindent'>NOBODY'S GIRL, published in France under the title
"En Famille," follows "Nobody's Boy" as a companion
juvenile story, and takes place with it as one of the
supreme juvenile stories of the world. Like "Nobody's
Boy" it was also crowned by the Academy, and that
literary judgment has also been verified by the test of
time.</div>

<div class="blockquot">Noble-minded little Perrine, left destitute and alone in the
slums of Paris, must find her rich grandfather, several days'
journey away, or no one knows what might happen to her.
Even when she finds him, in the midst of his great factories, he
may hate her because he had driven her father away from home
and disinherited him. How she had the courage to go on and
on until she reached Maraucourt, and obtained work in her
grandfather's factory, and at last found a way into his heart, is
through every step a story of the most absorbing interest to all
lovers of childhood. She triumphs over all discomforts, perils
and schemers with a firm faith in right things, and the perseverance
